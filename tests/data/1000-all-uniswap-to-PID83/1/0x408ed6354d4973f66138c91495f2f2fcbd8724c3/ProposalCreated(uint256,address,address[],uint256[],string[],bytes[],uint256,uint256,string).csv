This change is straightforward from a technical perspective and would help Uniswap compete in stablecoin <> stablecoin pairs, where the majority of the market share is taken by Curve and DODO.  ## Background on pool fees Uniswap v3 allows for the creation of new pools via calls to the [factory contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1F98431c8aD98523631AE4a59f267346ea31F984). In order to keep liquidity for pairs consolidated, only a few fee options are allowed–currently, 5, 30, and 100 basis points are supported (10, 60, 200 tick spacing).  Governance should add a 1 basis point fee option for the following reasons: * Curve’s stablecoin markets have 3-4 bps fees. * Dodo’s stablecoin markets have a 1 bps fee. * FTX’s fees for retail are 2/7bps fees and for whales 0/4bps.  However, we recognize there are some potential counterarguments to adding this fee tier: * Adding too many fee tiers can fragment liquidity. * Liquidity providers may earn less in fees.  ### We discuss each of these points in greater detail below This will allow for the creation of much more competitive stablecoin<>stablecoin pools.  Offering low slippage on stablecoin<>stablecoin pairs in AMMs is generally easier than other pairs due to their relatively low price volatility.  As such, the determining factor in driving volume is trading fees. Pouring more capital into a 5 bps fee pool won’t necessarily make Uniswap v3’s pricing more attractive, as lower cost pools exist such as [Curve’s 3pool](https://curve.fi/3pool) (3 bps fees) and [DODO’s USDC-USDT](https://app.dodoex.io/liquidity?network=mainnet) pool (1 bps fees). Indeed, [most USDC-USDT volume from 1inch is routed to DODO](https://dune.xyz/queries/135498). Very little of it is routed to Uniswap v3.  [In the DEX market as a whole](https://dune.xyz/queries/150801) (not just 1inch), DODO and Curve still take the majority of the market share (60-70%) in USDC-USDT trading. Uniswap v3’s concentrated liquidity helped increase market share, but lower fees can help it grab more.  The data tells a similar story for DAI-USDC (see [1inch exported volume](https://dune.xyz/queries/152001) and [overall market share](https://dune.xyz/queries/151999)), though in the case of DAI-USDC, DODO is less active. While the case is compelling just from competition in the DEX space, Uniswap also competes with centralized exchanges.  Many centralized exchanges offer lower than 5 basis point taker fees for high volume traders ([Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/fee/schedule) offers < 5 basis point fees above 40K BTC in 30-day volume, [FTX](https://help.ftx.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024479432-Fees) above $25M in 30-day volume, etc.). Lower fees could increase the DEX volume pie by comparing favorably to spot markets on centralized exchanges and drawing volume from large players. ### The change is a very light touch. The change requires just one function call–[`enableFeeAmount(100)`](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/b2c5555d696428c40c4b236069b3528b2317f3c1/contracts/interfaces/IUniswapV3Factory.sol#L77)–on the factory contract. Governance controls this contract, so a simple proposal could make this change.  The enableFeeAmount function takes as parameters  1. Fee: the fee amount denominated in 100ths of a basis point. 2. `tickSpacing`: the granularity one may specify a liquidity range (see the Uniswap v3 Core [whitepaper](https://uniswap.org/whitepaper-v3.pdf) for more details)  To add a 1 basis point fee option, fee would be 100.  `tickSpacing` requires some consideration. On the one hand, too high of a value restricts LPs’ ability to set granular prices, since initializable price ticks would be roughly [`tickSpacing`] basis points apart. On the other hand, too low of a value could entail liquidity being too low in each tick, meaning that larger orders may need to cross multiple ticks to fill, entailing extra gas cost for each additional tick.  We suggest that a value of 1 for `tickSpacing` would be reasonable for 1 basis point fee pools, allowing LPs to set prices with precision in positions that span ~1 basis point between initializable ticks.  For a stablecoin market like USDC-USDT, we expect most of the liquidity to reside in 6 ticks. Orders <$1m will like only require 1 tick and larger orders may require a second or third tick. For each tick used it adds about 15k-20k gas costs.  ### Too many fee tiers can fragment liquidity  The downside of adding too many fee tier possibilities is that liquidity is then fragmented across pools. However, we believe that LPs will naturally settle over time into the fee tier that is most appropriate for the volatility of the pair.  Pairs with particularly low volatility, like stablecoin<>stablecoin pairs, will likely have a liquidity migration to the 1 bps tier, as the required return to capital should be low in equilibrium given the low risk of impermanent loss.  ### LPs may earn less in fees  Assuming overall volume stays stable (although it’s worth mentioning more competitive fees should grow the pie), total fees paid will go down (volume would have to 5X for fees paid to LPs to stay the same).  However, LPs are not the only constituency to take into consideration–takers will be paying lower fees in aggregate. Growing Uniswap’s market share and being the best place to trade across many pairs is important. These pools could become more enticing to large traders looking to swap stablecoins, for instance.  ## Concluding Thoughts  We believe this simple change could boost Uniswap’s competitiveness in low volatility pairs, and the change presents minimal risk for Uniswap."

## Summary
The Polygon team proposes to authorize Uniswap Labs to deploy Uniswap protocol to Polygon PoS on behalf of the community.

We believe this is the right moment for Uniswap to deploy on Polygon, for several major reasons:

* Polygon PoS has the second strongest DeFi ecosystem, right after Ethereum L1;
* Deploying to Polygon PoS can bring a lot of benefits (user base growth, huge savings for users, higher user activity, higher revenue, market capture, return to the original DeFi vision etc);
* We are willing to incentivize Uniswap adoption, financially and otherwise;
* Polygon PoS is battle-tested;
* Polygon is aligned with Ethereum and its values.

We respectfully submit this proposal for your consideration, and we are looking forward to your questions and feedback.

We would be willing to commit up to $20M for the aforementioned financial incentives, and we propose to use these funds in the following way: 
* Up to $15M for a long-term liquidity mining campaign;
* Up to $5M towards the overall adoption of Uniswap on Polygon. 

In addition to the financial incentives we are offering will also be supporting the integration by: 
*  Actively participate in the design and execution of liquidity mining campaigns;
*  Work with prominent projects in the Polygon DeFi ecosystem to help them understand the benefits of using Uniswap V3 as a “money lego.”
*  Promote Uniswap as a “money lego” on hackathons and other developer-focused events and efforts etc.

## On-chain voting

This proposal has no on-chain functionality other than polling all Uniswap holders. Although the proposal already exceeded the 40m quorum threshold during the consensus check, the Uniswap community feels it is important to allow all UNI holders the opportunity to cast a vote. One important argument in favor of this decision is that Snapshot is not supported by custody providers like Coinbase, Anchorage, etc., smart contract wallets like Argent/Gnosis safe, or meta governance layers like Index & Compound. 

Governor Bravo requires at least one on-chain action, so the proposal includes a transfer of 0 UNI to satisfy the requirement.

If the proposal passes this phase, the Uniswap Labs can deploy Uniswap on Polygon on behalf of the Uniswap community."

## Proposal Summary

Voltz is a new DeFi primitive, bringing interest rate swaps to DeFi in a manner that is up to 3,000 times more capital efficient than alternative models. This is achieved through a variety of mechanisms, including the use of concentrated liquidity pioneered in Uniswap v3. However, since Uniswap v3 is subject to a Business Source License, Voltz is requesting an “Additional Use Grant” that would allow Voltz to use aspects of the v3 code within its codebase.

Given the significant R&D that went into v3, Voltz is offering 1% of Voltz future tokens alongside a number of non-financial benefits.

Beyond the financial benefit for Uniswap token holders, if approved, this will also represent a first for DeFi and set precedent for future Additional Use Grant requests.

## On-chain voting
We are now initiating the 3rd and final governance vote. 

Since license changes must be executed via the [ENS](https://ens.domains/) domain uniswap.eth (controlled by Uniswap Governance), the governance can link arbitrary text with any subdomain of the form: X.uniswap.eth. The details of how this is done can be found in the following repo (under the Licensing section), the full simulation of the proposal is done in [here](https://github.com/Voltz-Protocol/uniswap_proposal_simulation).

If passed, Voltz will be provided with an Additional Use Grant as per the terms of the Business Source License. 1% of Voltz Tokens will be provided to Uniswap Treasury following the Voltz Token Generation Event.

## **Summary**

* Nomic Labs, the team behind Hardhat, has become the Nomic Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to Ethereum. Our mission is to empower developers to decentralize the world.
* The Nomic Foundation’s work will be focused on Ethereum’s developer platform with the objective of achieving a world-class developer experience, and generally improving Ethereum’s public goods support structures.
* [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) is the de facto standard developer tool used to build Ethereum software, with more than 23000 Github repositories using it and tens of thousands of active users. Prominent teams relying on it include ENS, Uniswap, Optimism, OpenZeppelin, Aave, Balancer, Chainlink, Synthetix, and many more leading teams.
* The new foundation will expand the Hardhat suite of tools and, most importantly, build long-term infrastructure to catalyze organic growth in the Ethereum tooling ecosystem, decreasing Ethereum’s dependence on any one organization to build and maintain core development platform components.
* Seeking $30m in total funding from the ecosystem. Donations of $15M already secured by the Ethereum Foundation, Vitalik Buterin, Coinbase, a16z, The Graph, Polygon, Chainlink, a16z, and Kaszek Ventures.
* **We’re proposing to Uniswap Governance to make a contribution of $5m to the Nomic Foundation to support its mission.**

## **Funding**

The Nomic Foundation aims to benefit the entire Ethereum ecosystem, which is why we’re fundraising across multiple organizations and individuals within it.
The Ethereum Foundation is leading this round of contributions with $8M, alongside contributions from Vitalik Buterin, Coinbase, Consensys, The Graph, Polygon, Chainlink, Gnosis, a16z, a_capital, and Kaszek Ventures. These donors make up $15M, and we’re aiming to raise $15M more.

## **Why Uniswap?**

Generally, we think that allocating capital to the Nomic Foundation makes strategic sense for any protocol treasury that is aligned long term with the growth of Ethereum, and we’ve approached and will continue approaching several protocols.
Currently, Uniswap [is built using Hardhat](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/hardhat.config.ts). While this is a signal of Hardhat’s value, the projects that the Nomic Foundation will deliver will create more value not just for Uniswap, but for the entire ecosystem. We’ll provide services to the Ethereum community that will:

1. Continue the maintenance of critical infrastructure used to build most protocols (Hardhat).
2. Increase developer productivity for every team in the ecosystem.
3. Accelerate developer onboarding to Ethereum, increasing the size of the experienced engineering hiring pool and making time-to-productivity shorter for new hires.
4. Accelerate the pace of innovation and the number of products being built.
5. Increase market volume driven by new users and new products.

We believe this grows the market for everyone, including Uniswap, and we’d love to have the **Uniswap DAO contribute $5m in funding to this community effort** .

## Description

To date, Uniswap has four deployments: Ethereum, Abritrum, Optimism, and Polygon. In addition to these deployments, there are proposals to deploy Uniswap on Harmony, Celo, and more chains expected soon. The protocol should continue to deploy to new markets, but as the protocol continues to grow, it is vital the protocol learns to manage each of the deployments. With each new chain, there is new infrastructure that needs to be adapted to so that UNI on Ethereum can govern all of these deployments.

GFX Labs has been researching the various deployments and has prepared the first Uniswap cross-chain proposal to demonstrate how mainnet UNI can manage deployments on other chains.

Polygon has a messaging mechanism between Ethereum and Polygon called the [Fx-Portal](https://docs.polygon.technology/docs/develop/l1-l2-communication/fx-portal/). The portal functions via three contracts: FxRoot, State Sender, & FxChild. Messages can be sent from Ethereum to Polygon by calling the sendMessageToChild(address, bytes) at the FxRoot contract on Ethereum, which calls the State Sender contract. The [validators](https://docs.polygon.technology/docs/validate/polygon-basics/who-is-validator/) monitor the State Sender contract and relay messages to the FxChild on Polygon. Upon successful relay to the FxChild, the message is executed on Polygon by the validators.

The owner of the Uniswap v3 contracts on Polygon is the [Ethereum Proxy contract](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x8a1b966ac46f42275860f905dbc75efbfdc12374#code). The proxy contract will only process transactions that originate from the [Timelock contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1a9c8182c09f50c8318d769245bea52c32be35bc#code) on Ethereum and are delivered by the [FxChild](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x8397259c983751daf40400790063935a11afa28a). Every governance proposal targeting a change on Polygon should set the [FxRoot](https://etherscan.io/address/0xfe5e5d361b2ad62c541bab87c45a0b9b018389a2#code) on Ethereum as the target and send the message (parameter change) via the contract. The message passed through the FxRoot must contain the target(s) contract on Polygon, the function(s) to call, the call data(s), similar to the proposal system.

For the pilot of cross-chain governance, we are implementing the 1 basis point/1 tick fee tier on Polygon. The 1bp pools on Ethereum have been incredibly successful and increased Uniswap’s market share significantly since GFX Labs’ successful proposal in November 2021.

Because governance has already approved it on Ethereum, the content of this proposal should not be controversial and puts the focus on the research and implementation.

# Proposal

GFX Labs has already tested the governance proposal on Goerli & Mumbai.

To build the proposal–[Uniswap Governor Alpha](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x5e4be8bc9637f0eaa1a755019e06a68ce081d58f#writeContract): propose()

  Dear Uniswap community, 
  
  A few weeks ago we (Blockchain at Michigan in partnership with the [Celo Foundation](https://celo.org/) and the [Celo Climate Collective](https://climatecollective.org/)) submitted a proposal to deploy Uniswap V3 on Celo to launch “Green Asset” Liquidity Pools and expand access to Uniswap to the 6B smartphone users around the world.
  
  We initiated the [Temperature Check](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0x4fdc5d5c87669d3c99072541e1c775f8dee9b906241b2ce22203737b608c8e55) and [Consensus Check](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0xa5b0e54358d8a0bff4b90461873cd4bec83e57d7b87f2e18b9a4ff81539b21ca)  on Snapshot, where the proposal received strong support from the Uniswap community (~100%) voted yes for the proposal. Before putting forth the formal on-chain governance proposal, we wanted to ensure we worked closely with Uniswap Labs and the Uniswap community to put forth clear documentation on the cross-chain governance bridging. We believe this proposal is a first step in a long and fruitful collaboration between the Celo and Uniswap communities—a journey we are particularly excited to embark on.
  
  We’re excited to initiate the formal governance proposal. We’d love to receive your support in this proposal. The proposal discussion can be found [here](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/governance-proposal-deploy-uniswap-v3-on-celo/16686)
  
  ## Description
  In partnership with the Celo Foundation and the Celo Climate Collective, we propose to authorize the deployment of the Uniswap protocol to Celo on behalf of the community.
  
  Celo is a mobile-first, carbon-negative, EVM-compatible blockchain. Specifically, we propose launching Uniswap on the Celo platform to:
  * Increase Uniswap’s presence through $10M in financial incentives to Uniswap users, as well as  additional grant funding provided by the Celo Foundation to utilize Uniswap as a financial building block 
  * Bring Uniswap V3’s increased capital efficiency to the 6B smartphone users around the world
  * Create green asset liquidity pools with natural capital backed assets such as tokenized carbon credits (e.g. MCO2, TCO2, and GNT) and future nature backed assets issued on Celo like land and forests
  * Use Uniswap as a decentralized mechanism to rebalance the Celo Reserve with nature backed assets rather than relying on centralized exchanges
  * Foster pathways for future green use cases on Uniswap
  
  Overall, we believe the Uniswap community’s mission of creating a trustless and decentralized financial infrastructure accessible to anyone aligns with Celo’s vision of tackling climate change and achieving prosperity for all.

About Gnosis Chain
------------------

In production since 2018 (as the xDai Chain), the rebranded [Gnosis Chain](https://www.gnosischain.com/) is rapidly evolving with a new focus and mission. Gnosis Chain (GC) provides a real-world value chain that closely mirrors the Ethereum 2.0 ecosystem. This includes a beacon chain framework, rollups, and other vital functionality. GC will serve in a front-running capacity for important Ethereum 2.0 updates.

Tuned parameters on Gnosis Chain enable faster blocks and epochs, low-cost stable transactions, and the opportunity to construct trustless bridges and conduct seamless transfers between GC and the Ethereum 2.0 mainnet.

Proposal
--------

The Gnosis Chain team is committed to ecosystem development, adoption, and growth as the Eth2.0 landscape comes into focus. With a mission to ""accelerate Ethereum,"" Gnosis Chain is poised for expansion. With this in mind, we propose a Uniswap v3 deployment to Gnosis Chain. We believe there are many benefits for both Uniswap Labs and Uniswap users, some of which include:

1.  A DeFi ecosystem primed for growth. Once deployed, Uniswap would become a cornerstone DeFi engine for protocols using and interacting within the ecosystem. Perpetual Protocol is a flagship protocol on GC that relies on Uniswap v3. This deployment will enable Perpetual to continue to flourish on the Gnosis Chain. Additional bluechip app deployments with growing TVL include Curve, Sushiswap, and Tornado Cash, with many new and promising DeFi projects choosing Gnosis Chain as their home base. A list of current projects is available at [https://gnosischain.world/](gnosischain.world)

2.  An iterative environment. Uniswap Labs can experiment with new functionality and alpha test new features in a real-value environment (which differs from a test environment in that users behave differently with value on the line, token supply is limited, real adversaries exist, etc). Uniswap can spot and remediate any final potential issues stemming from important Ethereum updates prior to mainnet activation and take advantage of optimized slot and epoch times for faster iteration.

3.  Tight Ethereum compatibility. Tools, resources, projects, and protocols supported by Ethereum are already supported on Gnosis Chain, with more onboarding regularly. Gnosis Safe is facilitating daily operations for many existing projects. [A trustless bridge architecture designed to connect Ethereum and Gnosis Chain is in the works](https://hackmd.io/g8TK7IzYQjClTTaor-ypIQ). The [Gnosis Beacon Chain validator set](https://beacon.gnosischain.com/) is expanding rapidly bringing massive decentralization to the chain.\
    The primary differences separating the GBC from the Ethereum Beacon chain include 5-second blocks and < 2-minute epochs, stable transactions with a max target of $.01 per 100K gas, and an economically and geographically diverse validator set, and a lower-stakes, lower-TVL environment.

4.  Unique chain characteristics. Stable, low-cost transactions provide unique opportunities for Uniswap users. When gas costs are known and have a low impact on trade decisions, new strategies and approaches emerge which are currently untenable on the Ethereum mainnet or other chains with wide-ranging fee variability.

5.  User incentives. A large directive for the Gnosis Chain is to increase the user base and on-chain activity by strategically allocating funds from the GnosisDAO treasury to promote adoption. An ecosystem fund has been created for this purpose, and we propose to use a portion of these funds to promote Uniswap v3 on Gnosis Chain. We propose providing up to $10M to incentivize the adoption of Uniswap v3 on Gnosis Chain.

Details for incentivized Adoption of Uniswap v3
------------------------------------------------

The $10M will be provided in GNO to foster the usage of Uniswap v3 on Gnosis Chain. The incentives should be designed together with other projects, which are operating on top of Uniswap v3 such as Perpetual Protocol, Gelato, or Stakewise. This should allow for more sustainable utilization of Uniswap as Gnosis Chain doesn't have a team dedicated to Uniswap v3. The GNO can be used to incentivize liquidity but should not be limited to this use case. Anything increasing usage of Uniswap v3, including building new applications on top of Uniswap v3 should be supported. The goal is to spend the $10M in the time period of 2 years. Funds not used after two years would go back to GnosisDAO. The spending is limited to $10M and the transferred amount of GNO as part of the proposal. GnosisDAO can decide to top up this amount based on the outcome of this initiative.

Cross-Chain Governance with Nomad
---------------------------------

Since the Temperature Check, we have discussed with stakeholders within the Uniswap ecosystem, who have expressed a desire to see trust-minimized bridges used for governance for new Uniswap v3 deployments. In addition, we've also seen the [Nomad](http://nomad.xyz/) team's proposal to [deploy v3 on Moonbeam](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/consensus-check-deploy-uniswap-v3-to-moonbeam/16624), which includes a section addressing this, as well as documenting the current fragmented approach to governance across various v3 deployments.

In the interest of taking a standardized approach to cross-chain governance of v3 deployments moving forward, we've partnered with the Nomad team to leverage the Nomad generalized message passing channels to manage the governance of the Uniswap v3 deployment on Gnosis Chain.

We believe that Nomad is the best solution for cross-chain governance, as it:

-   [Supports generalized messages](https://docs.nomad.xyz/) between chains
-   Does not rely on a multi-sig or validator set, but rather leverages an optimistic mechanism that allows bad messages to be challenged via fraud proofs

Nomad will be deployed on Gnosis Chain shortly and will leverage [Gnosis Zodiac Modules](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac) as part of its governance stack.

We are excited about partnering with Nomad to create a trust-minimized governance stack that can offer a standard for the Uniswap ecosystem.

License Exemption
-----------------

We are requesting an exemption that will allow Gnosis Ltd. to use the Licensed Work to deploy it on Gnosis Chain, a layer 1 blockchain with deep connections to Ethereum, provided that the deployment is subject to Ethereum layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control.

Timeline
--------

Following the Consensus Check phase, we will submit this proposal shortly after to an on-chain vote. Provided that the proposal passes both steps, and all governance systems have been built and audited, we will be ready to move forward with the Uniswap v3 deployment on Gnosis Chain.

Proposal Acceptance and Execution
---------------------------------

As the proposal funding has to come from GnosisDAO, this proposal has to be accepted by both: UNI and GNO token holders. The execution of this proposal is dependent also on the acceptance of the proposal by GnosisDAO. The GnosisDAO proposal has to include the setup of the multi-sig and the allocation of GNO and would be executed once it is accepted by GNO token holders. Two singers from the Uniswap community and two singers from the GnosisDAO community should be selected to participate in the multisig wallet.

Conclusion
----------

The Gnosis Chain is preparing for substantial growth in the coming year. We have implemented an aggressive infrastructure grants program including large grants to Nethermind, Lighthouse and Erigon client teams to support base-layer functionality and security. The [ecosystem fund](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-16-gnosis-chain-xdai-gnosis-merge/1904) will bring in many new projects, and we feel Uniswap v3 is an essential component that will serve as a foundational layer for this growth.

We welcome any questions and comments and are happy to provide any clarifications as needed. We are excited to submit this proposal to the Uniswap community and look forward to your feedback! Thank you."

### Description 

Moonbeam is a Polkadot parachain which features EVM-compatibility, allowing it to serve as a port-of-entry for Ethereum-native apps to participate in the greater Polkadot ecosystem. 


 
We believe deploying Uniswap to Moonbeam will bring the following benefits to the Uniswap community:  

* **Expansion into Polkadot**: Uniswap will be able to tap into a brand new market and all the community members in the Polkadot ecosystem. Moonbeam’s EVM-compatibility makes it simple to deploy existing Solidity code, while simultaneously providing access to other parachains using XCM. By leveraging XCM and Moonbeam’s position as the DeFi hub for Polkadot, Uniswap has the opportunity to become the premier AMM across Polkadot. 

* **Trust-minimized Governance**: Per Uniswap’s goal of becoming a multi-chain protocol while remaining trust-minimized, we propose using Nomad’s trust-minimized channels to deploy Uniswap V3 on Moonbeam. This can serve as an opportunity to test this improved decentralized governance application within a safe container, with the potential of rolling it out to other V3 deployments in the future. 

* **Rewards for Uniswap Grants Program**: Instead of simply offering liquidity mining incentives, we want to fund community members working to develop and enrich multichain experiences built with Uniswap.

Context
-------

After passing the [Temperature Check vote](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0xb328c7583c0f1ea85f8a273dd36977c95e47c3713744caf7143e68b65efcc8a5) with 7M UNI voting in favor of deploying Uniswap v3 on Gnosis Chain (GC), and [Consensus Check](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0x729c19f1cafab8ed884914549e147ef401532cf6680e340a1aa0c8cc65f35f09) with 14M UNI voting, we are now posting this proposal as an on-chain governance proposal. To ensure the proposal executes as expected, we have provided [a simulation of hte transactions](https://github.com/gnosis/uniswap_proposal_simulation).

Here is a link to the [Consensus Check Discussion](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/consensus-check-should-uniswap-v3-be-deployed-to-gnosis-chain/16663).

About Gnosis Chain
------------------

In production since 2018 (as the xDai Chain), the rebranded [Gnosis Chain](https://www.gnosischain.com/) is rapidly evolving with a new focus and mission. Gnosis Chain (GC) provides a real-world value chain that closely mirrors the Ethereum 2.0 ecosystem. This includes a beacon chain framework, rollups, and other vital functionality. GC will serve in a front-running capacity for important Ethereum 2.0 updates.

Tuned parameters on Gnosis Chain enable faster blocks and epochs, low-cost stable transactions, and the opportunity to construct trustless bridges and conduct seamless transfers between GC and the Ethereum 2.0 mainnet.

Proposal
--------

The Gnosis Chain team is committed to ecosystem development, adoption, and growth as the Eth2.0 landscape comes into focus. With a mission to ""accelerate Ethereum,"" Gnosis Chain is poised for expansion. With this in mind, we propose a Uniswap v3 deployment to Gnosis Chain. We believe there are many benefits for both Uniswap Labs and Uniswap users, some of which include:

1.  A DeFi ecosystem primed for growth. Once deployed, Uniswap would become a cornerstone DeFi engine for protocols using and interacting within the ecosystem. Perpetual Protocol is a flagship protocol on GC that relies on Uniswap v3. This deployment will enable Perpetual to continue to flourish on the Gnosis Chain. Additional bluechip app deployments with growing TVL include Curve, Sushiswap, and Tornado Cash, with many new and promising DeFi projects choosing Gnosis Chain as their home base. A list of current projects is available at [https://gnosischain.world/](gnosischain.world)

2.  An iterative environment. Uniswap Labs can experiment with new functionality and alpha test new features in a real-value environment (which differs from a test environment in that users behave differently with value on the line, token supply is limited, real adversaries exist, etc). Uniswap can spot and remediate any final potential issues stemming from important Ethereum updates prior to mainnet activation and take advantage of optimized slot and epoch times for faster iteration.

3.  Tight Ethereum compatibility. Tools, resources, projects, and protocols supported by Ethereum are already supported on Gnosis Chain, with more onboarding regularly. Gnosis Safe is facilitating daily operations for many existing projects. [A trustless bridge architecture designed to connect Ethereum and Gnosis Chain is in the works](https://hackmd.io/g8TK7IzYQjClTTaor-ypIQ). The [Gnosis Beacon Chain validator set](https://beacon.gnosischain.com/) is expanding rapidly bringing massive decentralization to the chain.\
    The primary differences separating the GBC from the Ethereum Beacon chain include 5-second blocks and < 2-minute epochs, stable transactions with a max target of $.01 per 100K gas, and an economically and geographically diverse validator set, and a lower-stakes, lower-TVL environment.

4.  Unique chain characteristics. Stable, low-cost transactions provide unique opportunities for Uniswap users. When gas costs are known and have a low impact on trade decisions, new strategies and approaches emerge which are currently untenable on the Ethereum mainnet or other chains with wide-ranging fee variability.

5.  User incentives. A large directive for the Gnosis Chain is to increase the user base and on-chain activity by strategically allocating funds from the GnosisDAO treasury to promote adoption. An ecosystem fund has been created for this purpose, and we propose to use a portion of these funds to promote Uniswap v3 on Gnosis Chain. We propose providing up to $10M to incentivize the adoption of Uniswap v3 on Gnosis Chain.

Details for incentivized Adoption of Uniswap v3
------------------------------------------------

The $10M will be provided in GNO to foster the usage of Uniswap v3 on Gnosis Chain. The incentives should be designed together with other projects, which are operating on top of Uniswap v3 such as Perpetual Protocol, Gelato, or Stakewise. This should allow for more sustainable utilization of Uniswap as Gnosis Chain doesn't have a team dedicated to Uniswap v3. The GNO can be used to incentivize liquidity but should not be limited to this use case. Anything increasing usage of Uniswap v3, including building new applications on top of Uniswap v3 should be supported. The goal is to spend the $10M in the time period of 2 years. Funds not used after two years would go back to GnosisDAO. The spending is limited to $10M and the transferred amount of GNO as part of the proposal. GnosisDAO can decide to top up this amount based on the outcome of this initiative.

Cross-Chain Governance with Nomad
---------------------------------

Since the Temperature Check, we have discussed with stakeholders within the Uniswap ecosystem, who have expressed a desire to see trust-minimized bridges used for governance for new Uniswap v3 deployments. In addition, we've also seen the [Nomad](http://nomad.xyz/) team's proposal to [deploy v3 on Moonbeam](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/consensus-check-deploy-uniswap-v3-to-moonbeam/16624), which includes a section addressing this, as well as documenting the current fragmented approach to governance across various v3 deployments.

In the interest of taking a standardized approach to cross-chain governance of v3 deployments moving forward, we've partnered with the Nomad team to leverage the Nomad generalized message passing channels to manage the governance of the Uniswap v3 deployment on Gnosis Chain.

We believe that Nomad is the best solution for cross-chain governance, as it:

-   [Supports generalized messages](https://docs.nomad.xyz/) between chains
-   Does not rely on a multi-sig or validator set, but rather leverages an optimistic mechanism that allows bad messages to be challenged via fraud proofs

Nomad will be deployed on Gnosis Chain shortly and will leverage [Gnosis Zodiac Modules](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac) as part of its governance stack.

We are excited about partnering with Nomad to create a trust-minimized governance stack that can offer a standard for the Uniswap ecosystem.

License Exemption
-----------------

We are requesting an exemption that will allow Gnosis Ltd. to use the Licensed Work to deploy it on Gnosis Chain, a layer 1 blockchain with deep connections to Ethereum, provided that the deployment is subject to Ethereum layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control.

Timeline
--------

Following the Consensus Check phase, we will submit this proposal shortly after to an on-chain vote. Provided that the proposal passes both steps, and all governance systems have been built and audited, we will be ready to move forward with the Uniswap v3 deployment on Gnosis Chain.

Proposal Acceptance and Execution
---------------------------------

As the proposal funding has to come from GnosisDAO, this proposal has to be accepted by both: UNI and GNO token holders. The execution of this proposal is dependent also on the acceptance of the proposal by GnosisDAO. The GnosisDAO proposal has to include the setup of the multi-sig and the allocation of GNO and would be executed once it is accepted by GNO token holders. Two singers from the Uniswap community and two singers from the GnosisDAO community should be selected to participate in the multisig wallet.

Conclusion
----------

The Gnosis Chain is preparing for substantial growth in the coming year. We have implemented an aggressive infrastructure grants program including large grants to Nethermind, Lighthouse and Erigon client teams to support base-layer functionality and security. The [ecosystem fund](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-16-gnosis-chain-xdai-gnosis-merge/1904) will bring in many new projects, and we feel Uniswap v3 is an essential component that will serve as a foundational layer for this growth.

We welcome any questions and comments and are happy to provide any clarifications as needed. We are excited to submit this proposal to the Uniswap community and look forward to your feedback! Thank you."

### Abstract

This is a proposal for the Uniswap community to support important Ethereum Public Goods through the Protocol Guild: a vested split contract which goes to 110 core protocol contributors.

We propose that 500k UNI (~$2.5mm @ $5.19 UNI) be allocated to support the ongoing work of these core contributors in the initial Protocol Guild Pilot.

Participating in the 1 year Pilot allows guild members to engage with Uniswap in a way that is values- and incentive-aligned. Simultaneously, it will allow them to continue the important work of scaling our shared infrastructure and making it as resilient as possible for the applications on top of it.

### Context

1. As a credibly neutral, maximally uncapturable infrastructure with no block reward, the Ethereum base protocol doesn’t offer the same token incentives to contributors as applications or L2s can. However, the protocol still needs to attract and retain talent to continue to evolve. As the broader ecosystem continues to grow, competition for talented individuals will only increase. This isn’t to fault individuals for rationally weighting financial incentives, or protocols for leveraging the power of tokens - this is just the reality of the current context. We also acknowledge that financial motivations aren’t the only or best motivator for people, it’s just one tool in our toolset that is currently underleveraged.
2. Existing public goods funding solutions tend to be either too narrow or broad in scope, fail to exclusively target core protocol contributors, or depend on an intermediating institution, which often leads to organizations, and not individuals, being recipients of funds.
3. The Protocol benefits from contributor continuity. Transferring institutional knowledge between cohorts is more likely to happen successfully the more overlap there is.

Here’s a longer exploration of the [project rationale](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/1-proposal-rationale.html).

If we believe what we are building is important, then we should structure the incentives to attract more smart people to work on it. After all - “Ethereum is an unprecedented arena for playing cooperative games”; we should try to manifest the novel possibilities made possible by this arena. ([Griffith, 2019](https://medium.com/@virgilgr/ethereum-is-game-changing-technology-literally-d67e01a01cf8))

### What is the Protocol Guild?

The Protocol Guild aims to address the challenges mentioned above with a simple tool: a weighted split contract that includes vesting. Members will solicit sponsorships in the form of tokens from applications & protocols that build on Ethereum, which gives core contributors exposure to success at the application layer:

* current contributors are rewarded for past work through [time-based weighting](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/6-guidelines-for-regular-operation.html#weighting)
* current contributors contribute for longer periods, resulting in less contributor churn, better institutional knowledge transfer, and more stable core infrastructure
* new contributors are incentivized to join core protocol work, protocol evolution and maintenance is more robust

To date, the membership includes over 110 Ethereum protocol contributors, including researchers, client maintainers, upgrade coordinators, and more, all self-curated (member list [here](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/9-membership.html)). This is a broad-based ecosystem effort: members come from 22 different teams and 9 organizations. Only 30% of members are directly employed by the EF. The membership is continuously curated and there are quarterly updates to the split contract.

The Guild contracts will act as an autonomous value routing mechanism, operated independently from any existing institution, purpose-built for incentivizing long-term core protocol work. At no point does PG take custody of funds on behalf of members, it is all handled trustlessly.

### PG Pilot

Since starting the project in Nov 2021, we’ve built norms around member onboarding, refined the splitting and vesting mechanisms, and have created extensive documentation on how PG operates. At this point, we’re ready to test the mechanism’s efficacy with a 1 year / $10-20mm Pilot. We want to make sure the mechanism operates smoothly before graduating to a larger round with longer vesting periods. We are currently outreaching to 5-10 prominent Ethereum-based projects to get commitments for this important first milestone. We want to ensure there is a healthy diversity of contributing protocols both in terms of USD value as well as domain (eg. DeFi, staking, etc). The first commitment is from Lido to contribute [2,000,000 LDO](https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-to-fund-the-protocol-guild-pilot-via-a-lido-grant/2016/1), and the [vote](https://snapshot.org/#/ens.eth/proposal/0xe07284156fb063d5fba6b9fed50cc74fad36ea02c2ede0207434db476884104b) ([forum post](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep13-executable-support-the-protocol-guild-pilot/12877/50)) to contribute 200k ENS will conclude in the next few days.

The funds for the Pilot would be vested directly to Guild members over one year: see the [Pilot vesting contract here](https://app.0xsplits.xyz/accounts/0xF29Ff96aaEa6C9A1fBa851f74737f3c069d4f1a9/). Note that funds would not replace salaries for core contributors, and each recipient would be making an independent decision about how to use their tokens once vested.

### Proposal

We are inviting the Uniswap community to be part of this inaugural Pilot in the form of a 500k UNI transfer to the Protocol Guild’s vesting contract. We think this is an appropriate amount which balances between the current size of the treasury ([$1.2b as of May 16, 2022](https://openorgs.info/)), the number of beneficiaries, and the scope and intent of the Pilot.

There are a few reasons why supporting the Protocol Guild benefits the Uniswap community:

* Uniswap’s long-term success is tightly coupled with the continued evolution and maintenance of the Ethereum protocol. These are projects that often have multi-year timelines. Contributing to the Pilot meaningfully increases the incentive to contribute to the core protocol, including:
  * [The Merge](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/blob/master/Merge/mainnet-readiness.md): moving from PoW to PoS, increasing security and sustainability
  * EVM improvements: new functionality for developers like [EOF](https://notes.ethereum.org/@ipsilon/evm-object-format-overview)
  * [Statelessness](https://notes.ethereum.org/@gballet/Sy-a6T5St): sustainable management for state growth
  * Supporting L2 scaling: [EIP-4844](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4844), [EIP-4488](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4488)
  * [Proposer Builder Separation](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/pbs_censorship_resistance): reducing centralizing incentives for consensus participants
  * Continuous client maintenance: improving sync, exploring new database types, researching modular clients
  * Coordinating network upgrades: making sure the community helps to shape and is aware of network upgrades
* Having exposure to UNI allows protocol contributors to engage more with Uniswap governance. Members will be encouraged (but not obligated) to use the vested tokens in their respective governance framework.
* Uniswap should be among the protocols maximally aligned with the Public Goods of the largest ecosystem it operates in. Pilot participation maintains and expands the Uniswap community’s existing reputation for funding Public Goods.
* Diverse funding sources from the community further decentralizes protocol governance and prevents influence from pooling with any single entity.

([Griffith, 2019](https://medium.com/@virgilgr/ethereum-is-game-changing-technology-literally-d67e01a01cf8))

### What is the Protocol Guild?

The Protocol Guild aims to address the challenges mentioned above with a simple tool: a weighted split contract that includes vesting. Members will solicit sponsorships in the form of tokens from applications & protocols that build on Ethereum, which gives core contributors exposure to success at the application layer:

* current contributors are rewarded for past work through [time-based weighting](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/6-guidelines-for-regular-operation.html#weighting)
* current contributors contribute for longer periods, resulting in less contributor churn, better institutional knowledge transfer, and more stable core infrastructure
* new contributors are incentivized to join core protocol work, protocol evolution and maintenance is more robust

To date, the membership includes over 110 Ethereum protocol contributors, including researchers, client maintainers, upgrade coordinators, and more, all self-curated (member list [here](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/9-membership.html)). This is a broad-based ecosystem effort: members come from 22 different teams and 9 organizations. Only 30% of members are directly employed by the EF. The membership is continuously curated and there are quarterly updates to the split contract.

The Guild contracts will act as an autonomous value routing mechanism, operated independently from any existing institution, purpose-built for incentivizing long-term core protocol work. At no point does PG take custody of funds on behalf of members, it is all handled trustlessly.

### PG Pilot

Since starting the project in Nov 2021, we’ve built norms around member onboarding, refined the splitting and vesting mechanisms, and have created extensive documentation on how PG operates. At this point, we’re ready to test the mechanism’s efficacy with a 1 year / $10-20mm Pilot. We want to make sure the mechanism operates smoothly before graduating to a larger round with longer vesting periods. We are currently outreaching to 5-10 prominent Ethereum-based projects to get commitments for this important first milestone. We want to ensure there is a healthy diversity of contributing protocols both in terms of USD value as well as domain (eg. DeFi, staking, etc). The first commitment is from Lido to contribute [2,000,000 LDO](https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-to-fund-the-protocol-guild-pilot-via-a-lido-grant/2016/1), and the [vote](https://snapshot.org/#/ens.eth/proposal/0xe07284156fb063d5fba6b9fed50cc74fad36ea02c2ede0207434db476884104b) ([forum post](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep13-executable-support-the-protocol-guild-pilot/12877/50)) to contribute 200k ENS will conclude in the next few days.

The funds for the Pilot would be vested directly to Guild members over one year: see the [Pilot vesting contract here](https://app.0xsplits.xyz/accounts/0xF29Ff96aaEa6C9A1fBa851f74737f3c069d4f1a9/). Note that funds would not replace salaries for core contributors, and each recipient would be making an independent decision about how to use their tokens once vested.

### Proposal

We are inviting the Uniswap community to be part of this inaugural Pilot in the form of a 500k UNI transfer to the Protocol Guild’s vesting contract. We think this is an appropriate amount which balances between the current size of the treasury ([$1.2b as of May 16, 2022](https://openorgs.info/)), the number of beneficiaries, and the scope and intent of the Pilot.

There are a few reasons why supporting the Protocol Guild benefits the Uniswap community:

* Uniswap’s long-term success is tightly coupled with the continued evolution and maintenance of the Ethereum protocol. These are projects that often have multi-year timelines. Contributing to the Pilot meaningfully increases the incentive to contribute to the core protocol, including:
  * [The Merge](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/blob/master/Merge/mainnet-readiness.md): moving from PoW to PoS, increasing security and sustainability
  * EVM improvements: new functionality for developers like [EOF](https://notes.ethereum.org/@ipsilon/evm-object-format-overview)
  * [Statelessness](https://notes.ethereum.org/@gballet/Sy-a6T5St): sustainable management for state growth
  * Supporting L2 scaling: [EIP-4844](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4844), [EIP-4488](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4488)
  * [Proposer Builder Separation](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/pbs_censorship_resistance): reducing centralizing incentives for consensus participants
  * Continuous client maintenance: improving sync, exploring new database types, researching modular clients
  * Coordinating network upgrades: making sure the community helps to shape and is aware of network upgrades
* Having exposure to UNI allows protocol contributors to engage more with Uniswap governance. Members will be encouraged (but not obligated) to use the vested tokens in their respective governance framework.
* Uniswap should be among the protocols maximally aligned with the Public Goods of the largest ecosystem it operates in. Pilot participation maintains and expands the Uniswap community’s existing reputation for funding Public Goods.
* Diverse funding sources from the community further decentralizes protocol governance and prevents influence from pooling with any single entity.

Sponsored by GFX Labs for MiLLie

## Description

Since the original proposal to introduce a 1bp fee tier last fall [Discussion Adding 1 Basis Point Fee Pools in v3](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/discussion-adding-1-basis-point-fee-pools-in-v3/14216), there has been overwhelming data produced supporting the effectiveness of a 1bp fee tier in increasing swap volume on Uniswap.

Currently, the Uniswap 1bp fee tier is only available on Ethereum and Polygon ([Polygon 1bp Fee Tier 1](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/polygon-1bp-fee-tier/16488)), but I believe there is logic to deploying the fee tier to every chain that Uniswap is deployed to, given how impactful it is on stable swap volume. Optimism makes for an excellent candidate to deploy the 1bp fee tier to next, given the recent spike in activity.

Since this result of the proposal will be executed on Optimism, the executing action needs to be forwarded to the proper target. To do that, [Timelock](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1a9c8182c09f50c8318d769245bea52c32be35bc) will send the transaction to [OVM_L1CrossDomainMessenger](https://etherscan.io/address/0x25ace71c97B33Cc4729CF772ae268934F7ab5fA1#code) (Optimism mechanism to forward transactions from L1 to L2).

The transaction will then be sent via Optimism contracts to Uniswap’s [CrossChainAccount](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xa1dd330d602c32622aa270ea73d078b803cb3518#code), that is the privileged contract that can execute administrative tasks on protected contracts on L2 Optimism, and CrossChainAccount will forward the transaction, if it has the right origin, to the target Contract, in this case to [UniswapV3Factory](https://kovan-optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x1f98431c8ad98523631ae4a59f267346ea31f984).

This proposal has been already been executed on Kovan as a test.

# Uniswap Foundation: Preamble

**Uniswap has already changed the world.**

In only 3 years, the world’s first automated market maker has pioneered DeFi primitives, supported more than [$1T ](https://twitter.com/Uniswap/status/1529102980296867842)in cumulative volume, and served [millions of users ](https://dune.com/rchen8/defi-users-over-time)worldwide. Its daily volume today is [on par with Coinbase ](https://twitter.com/Clara_Medalie/status/1549048362489741313).

Ownership of the protocol was [transferred to the community ](https://uniswap.org/blog/uni)in 2020 and since then the Uniswap Grants Program (UGP) has demonstrated the potential for community-funded initiatives to make a positive impact. Over 1.5 years, UGP [has funded 120+ grantees ](https://mirror.xyz/kennethng.eth/0WHWvyE4Fzz50aORNg3ixZMlvFjZ7frkqxnY4UIfZxo) improving governance, and developing new interfaces and developer tooling.

However, there is still work to do to help Uniswap reach its full potential. The governance process has too much friction, the ecosystem is too difficult to navigate, and UGP in its current form is not able to fund the most ambitious and impactful projects.

**We want to change that.**

Today, we are excited to propose the creation of the **Uniswap Foundation**, which has the mission to support the decentralized growth and sustainability of the Uniswap Protocol and its supporting ecosystem and community.

In other words, the goal of the Uniswap Foundation is to support **you**.

Uniswap’s community is expansive, encompassing the universe of individuals and organizations which build on and benefit from decentralized protocols. Your contributions have already made Uniswap a success, but we want to help you accomplish much more.

The Uniswap Foundation (UF) will provide grants to builders, researchers, organizers, academics, analysts, and more to grow the Protocol and plan for its future.

It will make it easier to govern the protocol and community treasury, and to navigate the broader ecosystem.

It will help you make an impact – to reduce friction, and amplify your efforts.

**We believe that Uniswap will be the value exchange layer of the Internet.**

It brought the automated market maker to the masses.

It has led the way in the evolution and growth of DeFi and web3.

It is censorship resistant, permissionless, decentralized, and secure – constituting a set of properties which we believe should define our world’s financial infrastructure.

But there is still a long way to go for Uniswap to reach its full potential.

We’re excited to work with all of you to make that happen.

If you’re excited too, please read our proposal, comment, reach out to chat (our DMs - [@devinawalsh ](https://twitter.com/devinawalsh) and [@nkennethk ](https://twitter.com/nkennethk) are open!), and spread the word.

# Uniswap Foundation Proposal

This proposal is being put forth by the Uniswap Foundation, a Delaware corporation formed by Uniswap community members [Devin Walsh ](https://twitter.com/devinawalsh) and [Ken Ng ](https://twitter.com/nkennethk) to facilitate the steps outlined in this proposal.

# TL;DR

* Today, we are thrilled to propose the creation of the **Uniswap Foundation (UF)**.
* **Scope:** The UF, the first Foundation of a major protocol to go through the community governance process, will support the Protocol’s decentralized growth, reinvigorate governance, and serve as a Protocol advocate.
* **Team:** Devin Walsh will serve as the Executive Director, Ken Ng will serve as Head of Operations, and they will build out a team of 12.
* **Budget:** To fund these efforts, we are requesting:
  * A **$14M** Operating budget to cover a full team for 3 years
  * A **$60M** expanded Uniswap Grants Program (UGP) budget to cover 3+ years
  * We are requesting **$74M** total, which will be broken into two disbursements, with a first disbursement of **$20M**.
* **Governance Participation:** We are also requesting **2.5M UNI** to participate in governance, primarily through delegation. Through usage of a new smart contract primitive [The Franchiser ](https://github.com/NoahZinsmeister/franchiser), this UNI will be revocable by the DAO at any time, and cannot be used for any purpose outside of governance.

# Uniswap Foundation

## Mission

In pursuit of a more open and fair financial system, the Uniswap Foundation supports the decentralized growth and sustainability of the Uniswap Protocol and its supporting ecosystem.

## Key Activities and OKRs

We have listed our starting OKRs below. It’s possible these OKRs will have to change in the future. If they do change in a meaningful way, we will communicate that to the community.

**Growth:** Promoting Decentralization & Growth of the Protocol and Ecosystem

![OKR 1](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/6/619bc0745412b267da6d9b54787fc42bbd325493.png)

**Governance:** Reinvigorating the Uniswap Community Governance Process

![OKR 2](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/c/c8b88b9477f9c2c81ab5457cca4e9552781b3bf6.png)

**Advocacy:** Advocating for the Protocol and amplifying its positive social impact

![OKR 3](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/1/140c46d1c2e79f9e6dab44fbfb65826e578e3a59.png)

*Optimism Phase 0 token distribution link [here ](https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/gov-fund/)*

## Year 1 Roadmap

Our roadmap for the first year of operations includes but is not limited to the following activities:

![Year 1](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/0/0b9a3fb2b8ad0bb2eb400d0cdb1d391ee5ef9f06.png)

*Optimism Collective community Constitution link [here ](https://gov.optimism.io/t/working-constitution-of-the-optimism-collective/55)*

## Team

**[Devin Walsh ](https://twitter.com/devinawalsh), Executive Director (ED)**

As ED, Devin will be responsible for setting UF’s strategic vision alongside the Board and driving execution to achieve that vision.

Devin has been in crypto since 2016. She has conducted independent research for MIT’s [Digital Currency Initiative ](https://dci.mit.edu/), worked on decentralized identity at [uPort](https://www.uport.me/) (ConsenSys), and led protocol and venture investments at [CoinFund](https://www.coinfund.io/). She has consulted with [Edge & Node](https://edgeandnode.com/) and [cLabs ](https://clabs.co/), and led [MIRA ](https://miraimaging.com/), a seed stage startup at the intersection of fine art and NFTs. She recently resigned as Chief of Staff at Uniswap Labs in order to propose the creation of the UF.

**[Ken Ng ](https://twitter.com/nkennethk), Head of Operations**

As Head of Operations, Ken will build and scale processes to maximize the UF’s impact.

Ken has served the Uniswap ecosystem as Lead of the [Uniswap Grants Program ](https://www.unigrants.org/)for the past 1.5 years. He has helped run the Ethereum Foundation [Ecosystem Support Program ](https://esp.ethereum.foundation/), which gave Hayden his [initial grant ](https://blog.ethereum.org/2018/08/17/ethereum-foundation-grants-update-wave-3/)to build Uniswap. He served as COO of [Slingshot Finance ](https://slingshot.finance/)and cofounder of his nonprofit [eduDAO ](https://www.edudao.org/), which helps raise funds for students and teachers in the Bronx.

The needs, and thus the makeup, of our team may change over time. However, today we aim to hire for following roles, with a focus on filling the Grants and Governance roles first:

![Team|643x388](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/1/10a71f01254ea0ca59761b54934103bd60eb0400.png)

Applications are open today! Check out job descriptions [here ](https://jobs.lever.co/uniswapfoundation).

As noted by [Other Internet ](https://otherinter.net/research/uniswap-governance-findings/), there is also a need for new structures to “facilitate coordination across the complex web of stakeholders” within the Uniswap ecosystem. To provide this much needed coordination, the UF will be committed to working with a variety of independent parties (freelancers, development teams, research fellows, analysts, and more) to achieve many of its objectives.

## Advisors

The Foundation’s initial advisory team will be made up of the following individuals:

1. [Jesse Walden ](https://twitter.com/jessewldn), Founder and GP, [Variant](https://variant.fund/)
2. [Julia Rosenberg ](https://twitter.com/JulzRoze), Co-Founder, [Orca Protocol ](https://www.orcaprotocol.org/)
3. [Alexis Gauba ](https://twitter.com/AlexisGauba), Co-Founder, [Opyn ](https://www.opyn.co/); Co-Founder, [she256](https://she256.org/)
4. [Hart Lambur ](https://twitter.com/hal2001), Co-Founder of [UMA ](https://umaproject.org/)

In addition to advising UF on strategy and roadmap, this group will, alongside the Executive Director (ED) and Head of Operations,

1. Provide input on UF’s initial hiring decisions. This may include interviewing potential candidates and sharing feedback with the Committee as it determines its first hires, including its third Board member and at least next three team members.
2. Become temporary signers of the UF multi-sig, which will hold UF funds if and when the proposal is passed, for the sole purpose of executing approved proposals as instructed. This responsibility will be transitioned to UF team members once they are hired.

## Board

Devin Walsh and Ken Ng will serve as the first two Board members of the UF. Alongside the UF’s Advisors, they will interview and target to hire a third Board member in the first 3 months of operations.

## Budget

We are requesting $74M in UNI. This funding would be broken down into the following buckets:

* **$60M for Uniswap Grants Program**

Grants spending will be broken down into the below categories. We will revisit and readjust these categories as needed to ensure we continue to deploy resources where they are most impactful.

We are proud of the work done by UGP thus far (memorialized in this [retrospective ](https://mirror.xyz/kennethng.eth/0WHWvyE4Fzz50aORNg3ixZMlvFjZ7frkqxnY4UIfZxo)), and are incredibly excited to expand the scope of its work.

![Grants|491x419](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/7/76a8eaaca3579fafc751e294cefef2897875997d.png)

We are already in the process of assessing several high impact grant proposals which UGP would be excited to fund, if and when this proposal is passed. Two examples are:

1. A version of Uniswap v3 written in Cairo, to be deployed on Starknet
2. A prototype of an MEV estimation tool leveraging machine learning techniques built by respected academics in the space

We are also excited to continue funding ongoing work by existing grantees funded by UGP v0.1, including governance experiments and analyses from Other Internet, customer support from Serv.eth, and ETHGlobal hackathons.

To ensure community alignment with larger grants disbursements, the UF will put forth an off-chain Snapshot to the community for proposed grants larger than $2M.

We believe that this Grants budget will last approximately 3 years but this is subject to change depending upon the number and quality of applicants. We plan to approach the Treasury for additional Grants funds when there are ~6 months of funds remaining.

* **$14M operating budget** to build out a full team of 12 over the next two years.

In order to provide stability to our employees and to sustain the Foundation, we may make a request to the community for additional funding for further out than 3 years when we return to the Treasury at 6-12 months of operations (read more below).

Budget estimate looking forward three years is below.

![Budget|641x292](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/uniswap1/original/2X/1/18d2d1d5195b8baff08044fcfe21186a85926cc8.png)

**Inclusive of UNI vesting. In order to incentivize a highly qualified team, the UF will offer competitive compensation packages including both fiat and long-term vesting UNI. To provide full transparency, we will disclose UF financials later this year.*

***The UF will allocate an additional $2M in funds to cover legal fees in the case of unexpected future litigation.*

## Fund Disbursements

An approval of this proposal is an approval for the full **$74M** budget requested.

We are requesting the funds in two disbursements:

1. **$20M** now to cover operating expenses for the next 2 years and grants for 1 year. Assuming a UNI price of $8.14*, this initial request totals to **2,457,002 UNI.**
2. **$54M**, to be disbursed by the Uniswap Treasury in 6-12 months once the UF has completed the establishment of its legal entity. The UF will publish a post on the forum notifying the community a week prior to putting forth a formal governance proposal for the remaining funds. In other words, because this proposal approves the full amount of funding, we will not go through an additional the Temperature Check and Consensus Check steps to receive this second disbursement.

**To calculate our final UNI request we will use the 30 day TWAP on the day we put forth our Governance Proposal. $8.14 is approximately the 30 day TWAP as of 8/15/2022.*

## Governance Participation

The UF is also requesting **2.5M UNI** to participate in governance.

These tokens will be delegated to the UF by the Uniswap DAO through a new smart contract design, [The Franchiser ](https://github.com/NoahZinsmeister/franchiser), which ensures the tokens are only used for delegation, and allows the DAO to claw back the tokens at any time. The UF plans to use these tokens primarily for delegation to community members without the requisite 2.5M UNI to submit a governance proposal, however the UF may also self-delegate the UNI to vote, and to put up its own proposals.

The Franchiser was developed by [Noah Zinsmeister ](https://twitter.com/NoahZinsmeister)and was audited by [Trail of Bits ](https://www.trailofbits.com/).

# Next Steps

We are excited to discuss this proposal with the broader community as it passes through the Request for Comment phase. Should sentiment be positive, a Temperature Check Snapshot poll will be set up on Mon., August 8. If the Temperature Check poll passes, additional feedback will be incorporated before moving forward to the Consensus Check.

Additionally, to discuss the proposal and answer your questions, we plan to attend the Uniswap Community call at 4 PM EST on Wed., August 10, and to host a Twitter Spaces on @uniswapgrants at 11 AM EST on Tues., August 16.

## Addendum

### What is UF’s relationship with other ecosystem entities?

The goal of the UF is to be one of ***many*** organizations supporting the Protocol. UF’s overarching focus will be on seeding and growing an ecosystem of entities supporting the Protocol.

### What is UF’s relationship with Uniswap Labs?

The UF is an independent entity whose mandate will be to grow Uniswap’s usage, reinvigorate the governance process, and advocate for the protocol and community. To achieve those goals, it will build its own lean team, and provide grants to, support, and/or work alongside a number of existing and new values- and mission-aligned organizations.

Uniswap Labs is one of many organizations in the Uniswap ecosystem. It built, deployed, and, alongside many other teams, will continue to contribute to and build on the Protocol in the future.

As a commitment to the proper decentralization of the protocol, Uniswap Labs had previously provided a royalty free perpetual license for V3 and related trademarks to the Uniswap Grants Program and selected grantees at UGP’s discretion. To succeed, the UF will require the ability to grant v3 BSL license exemptions, to maintain the governance forum, [Sybil.org ](http://sybil.org/), and Protocol-related developer docs, and to help facilitate protocol development across many teams. Labs has given their blessing to this preliminary proposal for asset transition.

### What kind of legal entity will UF be?

Currently, this proposal is being made by the Uniswap Foundation, a pre-existing Delaware corporation formed by Uniswap community members Devin Walsh and Ken Ng. However, the UF team is conducting extensive research to determine the type of legal entity which best matches our ambitions, including our mission to make a positive social impact. The entity should also give the UF the ability to enter into contracts, open a bank account, and hire employees. Given these requirements, we are contemplating a US-based entity that would seek tax-exempt status. As there is no guarantee that tax-exempt status will be secured, we may make modifications to UF’s structure and operations in the future. We will share more about our path forward with the community as soon as we are able to.

### What will happen to the $UNI after it’s sent to the UF?

If the proposal passes, funds will be sent to the UF multi-sig, which is custodied by the ED, Head of Operations, and UF Advisors.

To provide runway for our team and grantees, we intend to convert all $20M of the initial UNI disbursement to stablecoins and fiat over the first month of operation. We have established relationships with multiple brokers, are also exploring private sale options, and plan to pursue an approach which will minimize UNI price impact.

We similarly plan to diversify the remainder of funds in the second disbursement. At least one month prior to transfer, the UF will publish a Foundation Treasury Diversification report for this UNI. In the report, we will detail the amount we plan to diversify, which broker we plan to use, and how we plan to price the UNI sold.

### How does UF’s Budget compare with the budgets of similar organizations across web3?

The **$74M** budget represents **~1.05%** of the total UNI supply. This is a relatively small percentage of UNI supply compared to the percentage of tokens allocated to Foundation and Grant programs by other protocol teams.

* 45% of OP tokens have been allocated to an Optimism Ecosystem Fund (25%) and Retroactive public goods funding (20%) ([here ](https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/allocations/#allocations-at-a-glance))
* An unpublished portion of ~22% of dYdX were allocated to current and future employees and consultants of the Foundation ([here ](https://docs.dydx.community/dydx-governance/start-here/dydx-allocations))
* ~26% of GRT was allocated to The Graph Foundation, educational programs, and grants ([here ](https://thegraph.com/blog/announcing-the-graphs-grt-sale))
* 25% of CELO was allocated to Community and Operational Grants ([here ](https://medium.com/celoorg/understanding-cgld-allocation-estimated-circulating-supply-over-time-f08a063a23ad))
* 12.5% of SOL was allocated to the Solana Foundation ([here ](https://messari.io/asset/solana/profile/launch-and-initial-token-distribution))
* The Ethereum Foundation holds a treasury of $1.6B ([here ](https://ethereum.foundation/report-2022-04.pdf))

### What happens to UGP and the UGP Subcommittees?

To start, UGP will continue operations as it exists today with the existing Allocation Committee. Once the Grants Lead is hired, they will lead all grants funding decisions and require final approval from either Devin or Ken (⅔ approval required from Grants Lead, Ken, and Devin).

UF plans to continue to fund the existing UGP subcommittees as separate, supportive entities. [The Stable ](https://www.notion.so/3430a00270ea4d79be5c70d4ca99680a?v=b7b7697e1ff44055b87a6bd3480a3b2d&p=ed5d138f443d4c13997bf1572cfbd2e7)subcommittee will continue to be made up of Ken and [Boris ](https://twitter.com/B0R444). The UGP Community Analytics subcommittees will continue to be made up of [Yj ](https://twitter.com/uniyj1), [Fede](https://twitter.com/Fly_Ams), [RantumBits ](https://twitter.com/RantumBits), [Annamira ](https://twitter.com/annamirajo), TZM, and [Trea Qura](https://twitter.com/Treaqura).

### How does the UF plan on being sustainable over time?

This proposal would fund UF operations for at least 3 years. In the future, we plan to return to the community to increase our operating budget when we approach 18 months of runway.

We also predict our grants budget will last approximately 3 years. In the future, we plan to return to the community to increase our grants budget when we approach 6 months of funds remaining.

### What is UGP, and how do I find out more about it?

The Uniswap Grants Program started after going through a [governance vote](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-uniswap-grants-program-v0-1/9081) in December 2020 for an allocation of $1.5M in UNI intended to last 6 months. While the initial set of priorities for UGP was narrowly scoped as an MVP to seed the ecosystem of developers, it has since grown to encompass more, including governance research, community building and education, and core protocol work. Due to the crypto market bull run we were able to give $7M in grants over 18 months.

Grants researcher [@sovereignsignal ](https://twitter.com/sovereignsignal)also recently put together a fantastic (independent) write-up on the history of the UGP [here](https://sovereignsignal.substack.com/p/breaking-down-the-uniswap-grants).

### What does a successful UGP grant look like? What are some UGP success stories?

Grantees have done some incredible work over the past 1.5 years - for more information, check out our recent [retrospective ](https://mirror.xyz/kennethng.eth/0WHWvyE4Fzz50aORNg3ixZMlvFjZ7frkqxnY4UIfZxo) on UGP v0.1.

However, most UGP grantees are less than a year old. Just like with any product, it may take some time and several iterations for grant projects to develop traction and see adoption. The first version of Uniswap only worked for a single LP and ETH/ERC20 pair, and looked much different than the Uniswap we know and love today (still live [here ](https://haydenadams.github.io/uniswap-retro/)!). [Hardat ](https://hardhat.org/), too, took time to become what it is today - Nomic Labs received its first grant in 2018.

With that being said, not every grant will have the same outcome as a Uniswap or Hardhat. Not every grant will have runaway adoption, just like with any startup. Even when a project does not have the expected or intended impact, it can still have a positive impact on the ecosystem, bringing in new developers, users, and ideas.

Grantee success can be a range of impactful outcomes and, although we can’t pick favorites, some notable highlights are:

* [Serv.eth](https://serveth.support/) Discord support - a globally distributed team of 10 supporting the Uniswap Discord server all hours of every day. They have resolved over 15,000 community support tickets (and counting!), from helping users set up their first wallet and making their first trades, to identifying scammers and helping others retrieve funds.
* [GFX labs](https://gfx.xyz/) cross-chain governance research - The GFX team have been active Uniswap contributors since the beginning — they were one of the first LPs on v3! Their UGP-funded research led to the the Protocol’s first cross-chain governance proposal, the deployment of the [1bps fee tier](https://app.uniswap.org/#/vote/2/14?chain=mainnet) on Polygon.
* [Chaos Labs](https://chaoslabs.xyz/) [TWAP hardhat plugin](https://github.com/ChaosLabsInc/uniswap-v3-oracle-cli) - One of Uniswap’s most under-appreciated innovations is the [TWAP oracle](https://chaoslabs.xyz/posts/chaos-labs-uniswap-v3-twap-deep-dive-pt-1), a core but admittedly complex DeFi primitive. Chaos Labs recognized the need for more robust tooling and documentation to make integrating TWAPs more accessible. They created a Hardhat plugin so anyone can leverage its robust security and accurate price reporting.
* [Scopelift](https://www.scopelift.co/) Seatbelt & Flexible Voting- Scopelift productionised [Seatbelt](https://github.com/Uniswap/governance-seatbelt) for governance testing. This test suite not only protects against unverified contracts, but also simulates proposals locally to ensure they deploy results properly. Additionally, their initial work on [Flexible Voting](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-upgrading-to-a-flexible-voting-enabled-governor/17098) would enable governance tokens locked in other protocols (for example, cUNI) to be leveraged for cross-protocol governance voting.
* [OmniAnalytics](https://omnianalytics.org/) [uniswappeR](https://github.com/Omni-Analytics-Group/uniswappeR) - The first R package created to interact with, quickly query, and trade on Uniswap, opening the door for more advanced data analyses. The Omni team went above and beyond their grant scope to deliver video [tutorials](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=GpWZLMB2lvM), extensive [documentation](https://github.com/Omni-Analytics-Group/uniswappeR), and an easy [dashboard generator ](https://github.com/Omni-Analytics-Group/uniswappeR-dashboarding)for in-depth exploration of trade history, LP and price simulations under infinitely customizable conditions including slippage and liquidity depth.
* [TechEducators](https://techeducators.co.uk/) Solidity Bootcamp - As an established web2 bootcamp, the team behind ETHAnglia have built an open source Solidity Bootcamp to better usher web2 developers into web3 with a focus on building secure Ethereum dApps. Their target demographic reaches to underserved populations in the UK, offering scholarships and free mentorships. Through this work, they have received recognition and further support from the UK government through the Department for Works and Pensions.

### How will UGP be improved within the UF?

Even with the success cases listed above, there are a number of ways that we’re excited to improve UGP for the benefit of the ecosystem.

* **Provide grants to universities and research institutions:** Today, UGP is a multisig without a legal entity so we are unable sign contracts with or award grants to universities and academic research institutions, among others. As a legal entity, the UF would allow us to work with these organizations.
* **Diversify assets:** No legal entity also means UGP could not diversify its assets out of UNI due to a lack of clarity around tax liability. This has made it impossible to scope out and provide larger and longer-term grants due to UNI price risk. The ability to diversify our assets will allow us to award these kinds of grants, for more ambitious and impactful projects.
* **Full-time well-compensated team:** UGP v0.1 was able to pay its small group of contributors part-time (≤30 hours per week). With an entity and full budget, the UF will be able to hire a full-time and well-compensated team. We also want to recognize the fact that a few UGP team members would still work 40+ hour weeks and weekends, uncompensated, due to a love for this work!
* **Upscale all of UGP:** With a formal entity, larger budget, and a full-time team, we would be able to improve our internal processes, from the applicant pipeline through feedback cycles, decisions, disbursements, and ongoing grantee management. We can do more in proactive outreach to fill our pipeline with fresh ideas and new teams. We could shine more of a spotlight on the impact grantees have had on the community. We will also be able to scale up our legal and accounting capabilities required for a more comprehensive grants program.
* **More communication:** With a larger team and a Comms/Social Media Lead, the UF would be able to more frequently highlight the work of grantees, as well as its own processes, decision-making frameworks, and operations to the community.

**Summary**

To support Uniswap's multichain mission and expand cross-chain experiences, we propose the deployment of Uniswap V3 to zkSync 2.0 on behalf of the community.

-   zkSync ecosystem has over [100 projects](https://ecosystem.zksync.io/) committed to launching on mainnet, including top DeFi protocols, infrastructure, on/off ramps, etc.

-   Deploying on zkSync will onboard new users & increase user activity on Uniswap by decreasing costs compared to Ethereum without security degradation

-   zkSync shares Ethereum's ethos as a free open-source project with a commitment to personal sovereignty, decentralization and community ownership

We welcome feedback from the community on the proposal, including suggestions on how it can be improved.

**About zkSync**

zkSync 2.0 is a [ZK rollup](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/zk-rollups/) that supports generalized EVM compatibility for the Ethereum blockchain. The primary benefit of zkSync 2.0 is that developers who have created EVM dApps can port to zkSync 2.0 effortlessly and realize significantly lower gas fees and more transactions per second without compromising on security.

zkSync 2.0 is a significant leap forward in Layer 2 technologies with long awaited improvements and benefits for Ethereum developers:

-   EVM Compatible - supporting generalized EVM smart contracts on a ZK rollup making it easy to deploy existing dApps 

-   ToolChain Compatible - able to port smart contracts with existing tools

-   Ethos Compatible - aligned with the ethos of decentralization and open-source

-   Certainty - using zero knowledge proofs offering certainty of security not probability 

-   Future Proof - ecosystem partners that adopt zkSync 2.0 now will enjoy all future improvements without the need to change their code

There is broad consensus that ZK rollups are the endgame for scaling Ethereum. zkSync's EVM compatibility, ease of use, and composability will accelerate developer and retail adoption. Top researchers including [Vitalik Buterin](https://youtu.be/XW0QZmtbjvs) recognize ZK rollups as the long term scaling solution.

**Security & Bridges**

ZK rollups are the most secure scalability solution available today as they rely purely on math to fully inherit the security of Ethereum. There is a general L1<>L2 communication bridge which will support arbitrary message passing and secured by validity proof and Ethereum consensus.

Bridge validators can't pass an incorrect message or change the content, the worst case would be to censor everyone. Importantly, we'll be building out additional safety functionality and monitoring off & on-chain activity.

[Security is top of mind](https://docs.zksync.io/dev/security/approach/#_1-security-by-correctness) for zkSync. We are currently working with tier-1 auditors for zkSync 2.0 and specifically in the review process for the bridge code. Audits will be conducted before each major upgrade. Besides audits, we offer a substantial [bug bounty program](https://docs.zksync.io/dev/security/bug-bounty/).

**Proposal**

There's significant value in Uniswap being available on an EVM compatible ZK rollup. Deploying early on zkSync helps solidify Uniswap's place as the number one DEX and a thought leader.

Importantly, it will help grow a large list of projects that can be built on Uniswap V3. Established projects like Argent, Curve, and Yearn have committed to launch along with [over 100 more projects](https://ecosystem.zksync.io/) and big infrastructure players like Chainlink, The Graph, Gnosis are supporting the ecosystem. Growing the public smart contract libraries interfacing and using Uniswap v3 codebase will solidify Uniswap's influence in the Ethereum ecosystem which is moving on to ZK rollups.

While the zkSync ecosystem is already experiencing very fast growth, the team is planning  programs to attract and fund innovative projects and research partners to accelerate the network's adoption and in turn, Uniswap's usage.

**License Exemption**

We are requesting an exemption via an Additional Use Grant (license change enacted via the ENS domain uniswap.eth) that would allow Matter Labs to use the Licensed Work to deploy it on zkSync provided that the deployment is subject to Ethereum layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control. Uniswap V3 will be deployed on zkSync by Matter Labs through the ""[Deploy Uniswap V3 Script](https://github.com/Uniswap/deploy-v3#deploy-uniswap-v3-script)"" albeit we may need to modify the compilation step with approval from the Uniswap Labs team.

**Timeline**

Following the Governance Proposal we will be ready to move forward with the Uniswap V3 deployment on zkSync.zkSync has been on testnet since February 2022 and plans to launch mainnet [early October](https://blog.matter-labs.io/100-days-to-mainnet-6f230893bd73). A timely assessment of the deployment of Uniswap v3 code to zkSync is important: while deploying on zkSync is fast and easy because it's fully EVM compatible, we estimate the full effort will take 4-6 weeks given Uniswap's relevance. This allows for proper testing, communication to the community and engagement with the broader zkSync ecosystem."

## Background:

On Ethereum, Uniswap Labs governance consists of a suite of smart contracts. However, in addition to its original deployment on Ethereum L1 mainnet, Uniswap contracts are also deployed on four additional domains - Polygon, Optimism, Celo, and Arbitrum.

Uniswap deployments on these domains do not have native access to the on-chain governance system, nor the UNI tokens which grant voting power in this system on Ethereum mainnet; in order for the existing Uniswap governance system to execute proposals governing these deployments, there must be some method of passing governance decisions from Ethereum mainnet to other domains.

Presently, this method has been implemented differently for each of the four chains. The system governing Optimism and Polygon follow similar design principles, and should be functional for passing proposals.

***The system governing the Arbitrum deployment was mis-configured due to a mis-communication between developers, and will require more involved intervention to repair.***

## Problem:

Arbitrum was initially going to allow L1 addresses to pass calls directly to L2 with msg.sender preserved. After realizing security issues with this approach, Arbitrum team instead shifted their approach to use aliasing (this method transforms L1 addresses to be a different address when represented on an L2):

Uniswap Labs was not made aware of this change in approach before deploying on Arbitrum. The Uniswap Factory was deployed with the owner set to the same, unaliased address of the L1 Uniswap Timelock contract.
To verify, see: owner address https://arbiscan.io/address/0x1a9c8182c09f50c8318d769245bea52c32be35bc set at https://arbiscan.io/address/0x1F98431c8aD98523631AE4a59f267346ea31F984#readContract
This address on Arbitrum is an EOA (not a contract) which nobody has the private key to control
The governance deployer key on Arbitrum has burned the nonce that could deploy a contract to this address, verifiable here: https://arbiscan.io/address/0x41653c7d61609d856f29355e404f310ec4142cfb
Therefore, nobody can execute governance proposals on Arbitrum in the current state

## Solution:

To fix the cross chain messaging bridge, Arbitrum proposes the following:

1. Final governance vote kicks off (after Temperature and Consensus checks pass).
2. Before the vote passes, Arbitrum will add a temporary exception to disable address-aliasing for messages from the L1 TimeLock contract, 0x1a9c8182c09f50c8318d769245bea52c32be35bc. Arbitrum will notify the Uniswap community via the Uniswap governance forum once this is done.
3. Once the final on-chain governance vote passes, the Uniswap governance contract will send a cross-chain message from the L1 Timelock contract to call setOwner on the L2 Uniswap factory, setting the owner to the L1 Timelock’s address alias, 0x2BAD8182C09F50c8318d769245beA52C32Be46CD.

* <em>This is the L1 Timelock address + the alias offset: 0x1a9c8182c09f50c8318d769245bea52c32be35bc + 0x111
1000000000000000000000000000000001111 as described further at https://developer.offchainlabs.com/arbos/l1-to-l2-messaging#address-aliasing</em>

4. We will be able to see when this is completed on-chain. Arbitrum will re-enable aliasing for the L1 Timelock contract address. Once this is complete, cross-chain governance between Uniswap and Arbitrum will be fully functional.

## Conclusion

Uniswap is currently the leading decentralized exchange by TVL on Arbitrum, and if this proposal passes the temperature check and continues along the governance process, it will strengthen the current relationship between the two projects.

# Deploy Uniswap v3 on Boba Network

## Summary

The Boba Network is granted an additional use grant to use the Uniswap V3 Core software code (which is made available to the Boba Network subject to license available at [here ](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/LICENSE)(the “Uniswap Code”)). 

As part of this additional use grant, the Boba Network receives license to use the Uniswap Code for the purposes of a full deployment of the Uniswap Protocol v3 onto the Boba Network L2 on Ethereum blockchain. The Boba Network are permitted to use subcontractors to do this work.  This license is conditional on the Boba Network complying with the terms of the Business Source License 1.1, made available at https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/LICENSE.

Boba Network and FranklinDAO (Prev. Penn Blockchain) are submitting this proposal to Deploy Uniswap v3 on Boba Network.

## Summary
In cooperation with DMA Labs (a major contributor to [ICHI’s](https://www.ichi.org/) Uniswap v3 management protocols) and support of furthering the vision of Multichain Uniswap 15, we propose that the Uniswap community vote to authorize the deployment of Uniswap v3 to Boba Network.

Boba Network is a blockchain Layer 2 scaling solution and [Hybrid Compute](https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2022/07/boba-networks-hybrid-compute-why-it-will-unlock-blockchains-true-potential) platform offering lightning fast transactions and fees anywhere from 40-100x less than the respective Layer 1. Boba’s Hybrid Compute brings the power of Web2 on-chain, with smarter smart contracts that allow developers and creators to leverage off-chain compute and real-world data to offer an enriched experience unlike anything else on the market today.

In addition, Boba Network is the first and only [multichain ](https://www.theblock.co/post/149837/ethereum-layer-2-boba-network-integrates-with-fantom-and-moonbeam) Layer 2, deploying on leading Layer 1 chains such as Ethereum, Avalanche, BNB and Moonbeam. Deploying on Boba will expand the Uniswap community to include users of the Boba multichain ecosystem, helping Uniswap on its journey to become a leading product in the multichain world.

The timeline for deployment will be approximately 3-4 weeks following the Governance Proposal, with contract deployment being handled by the Boba Network team .

## Proposal

We believe there are many benefits for the Uniswap Protocol, some of which include:

Ethereum equivalence. Developer tools, resources, projects, and protocols supported by Ethereum are already supported on Boba Network. A trustless bridge architecture to bridge assets from Ethereum to the Boba Network L2 has been in place since mainnet launch, with many bridging partners extending our bridge capabilities, such as Across.to, Synapse, Multichain and Layerswap.

Low cost transactions with high security. As an Ethereum L2, Boba Network relies on Ethereum’s strong base layer security while providing very low cost transactions, with fees anywhere from 40-100x less than Ethereum.

## Details for Incentivized Adoption of Uniswap v3

Boba Network will provide $1M $BOBA tokens to foster the usage of Uniswap v3 on Boba Network. The tokens will be sent to a multisig wallet co-owned by the Uniswap Grants Program (UGP) and Boba Network, who will work to deploy the funds as follows:

The incentives should be designed together with other projects which are operating on top of Uniswap v3 such as ICHI, Perpetual Protocol, Paraswap, or 1inch. The $BOBA can be used to incentivize liquidity but should not be limited to this use case. Anything increasing the usage of Uniswap v3 on Boba Network, including building new applications on top of Uniswap v3, should be supported. The goal is to deploy the $1M in the time period of one year. Funds not used after two years would go back to Boba. The spending is limited to $1M - the transferred amount of $BOBA as part of the proposal. Boba Network can decide to increase this amount based on the outcome of this initiative. In addition to this, Boba Network has already contributed more than $4M of liquidity on Uniswap v3 to bootstrap the initial success of Uniswap v3 on the Boba Network.

## Security

Boba Network is designed so that users can send arbitrary messages between smart contracts on L2 and L1. Users can relay messages themselves. The security of the messages passed is secured within the rollup protocol. Bridging and sequencing transactions is based on Optimism’s [Optimistic Rollup](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism) codebase. From L1 to L2, users need to trigger the CanonicalTransactionChain contract on L1 to create a new block on Boba Network. Our Sequencer is then forced to include the transaction on L2. From L2 to L1: Making provable statements about the state of Boba requires a cryptographic commitment in the form of the root of the Boba’s state trie to a smart contract on L1 called the StateCommitmentChain. We regularly publish updates of the state trie. With Merkle tree proofs of the commitments, users can use these proofs to make verifiable statements about the data within the storage of any contract on Boba at a specific block height. This can then be used to enable contracts on Boba L2 to send messages to contracts on L1.

The bridge uses the security of the source chain (L1). In an Optimistic Rollup design, state commitments are published to L1 without any direct proof of the validity of these commitments. Instead, these commitments are considered pending for a period of time (called the “challenge window”). In the challenge window the commitment could be invalidated through a fraud proof. Fraud proof challenges are not enabled and there’s a single sequencer design currently in production. In the event of fraud, the malicious actor and the prover of fraud will (in the future) play out an interactive challenge game and the malicious actor will be slashed.

The Boba Network codebase and Optimism’s codebase have undergone multiple audits, with no outstanding vulnerabilities.

More details about Boba Network can be found on our [engineering roadmap](https://boba.network/engineering-roadmap-2022-2023/).

## License Exemption
We are requesting an exemption that will allow Boba Network to use the Licensed Work to deploy it on Boba Network, a Layer 2 blockchain on Ethereum, provided that the deployment is subject to Ethereum Layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control.

**For - Deploy Uniswap v3 to Boba**

**Against - Make no change**

## Conclusion

Boba Network is primed for substantial growth in the coming year. We have implemented an aggressive developer acquisition program for projects building on not just our Ethereum L2, but also on top of Boba L2s for other chains like Avalanche, BNB, and Moonbeam. Our approach will bring in many new projects, and we feel Uniswap v3 is an essential component that will serve as a foundational layer for this growth.

We welcome any [questions and comments](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/deploy-uniswap-v3-to-boba-network/18018) and are happy to provide any clarifications as needed. We are excited to submit this proposal to the Uniswap community and look forward to your feedback! Thank you.

## Background:

On Ethereum, Uniswap Labs governance consists of a suite of smart contracts. However, in addition to its original deployment on Ethereum L1 mainnet, Uniswap contracts are also deployed on four additional domains - Polygon, Optimism, Celo, and Arbitrum.

Uniswap deployments on these domains do not have native access to the on-chain governance system, nor the UNI tokens which grant voting power in this system on Ethereum mainnet; in order for the existing Uniswap governance system to execute proposals governing these deployments, there must be some method of passing governance decisions from Ethereum mainnet to other domains.

Presently, this method has been implemented differently for each of the four chains. The system governing Optimism and Polygon follow similar design principles, and should be functional for passing proposals.

***The system governing the Arbitrum deployment was mis-configured due to a mis-communication between developers, and will require more involved intervention to repair.***

## Problem:

Arbitrum was initially going to allow L1 addresses to pass calls directly to L2 with msg.sender preserved. After realizing security issues with this approach, Arbitrum team instead shifted their approach to use aliasing (this method transforms L1 addresses to be a different address when represented on an L2):

Uniswap Labs was not made aware of this change in approach before deploying on Arbitrum. The Uniswap Factory was deployed with the owner set to the same, unaliased address of the L1 Uniswap Timelock contract.
To verify, see: owner address https://arbiscan.io/address/0x1a9c8182c09f50c8318d769245bea52c32be35bc set at https://arbiscan.io/address/0x1F98431c8aD98523631AE4a59f267346ea31F984#readContract
This address on Arbitrum is an EOA (not a contract) which nobody has the private key to control
The governance deployer key on Arbitrum has burned the nonce that could deploy a contract to this address, verifiable here: https://arbiscan.io/address/0x41653c7d61609d856f29355e404f310ec4142cfb
Therefore, nobody can execute governance proposals on Arbitrum in the current state

## Solution:

To fix the cross chain messaging bridge, Arbitrum proposes the following:

1. Final governance vote kicks off (after Temperature and Consensus checks pass).
2. Before the vote passes, Arbitrum will add a temporary exception to disable address-aliasing for messages from the L1 TimeLock contract, 0x1a9c8182c09f50c8318d769245bea52c32be35bc. Arbitrum will notify the Uniswap community via the Uniswap governance forum once this is done.
3. Once the final on-chain governance vote passes, the Uniswap governance contract will send a cross-chain message from the L1 Timelock contract to call setOwner on the L2 Uniswap factory, setting the owner to the L1 Timelock’s address alias, 0x2BAD8182C09F50c8318d769245beA52C32Be46CD.

* <em>This is the L1 Timelock address + the alias offset: 0x1a9c8182c09f50c8318d769245bea52c32be35bc + 0x111
1000000000000000000000000000000001111 as described further at https://developer.offchainlabs.com/arbos/l1-to-l2-messaging#address-aliasing</em>

4. We will be able to see when this is completed on-chain. Arbitrum will re-enable aliasing for the L1 Timelock contract address. Once this is complete, cross-chain governance between Uniswap and Arbitrum will be fully functional.

## Conclusion

Uniswap is currently the leading decentralized exchange by TVL on Arbitrum, and if this proposal passes the temperature check and continues along the governance process, it will strengthen the current relationship between the two projects.

[Governance Forum Post](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/deploy-uniswap-v3-to-boba-network/18018)

## Summary
In cooperation with DMA Labs (a major contributor to [ICHI’s](https://www.ichi.org/) Uniswap v3 management protocols) and support of furthering the vision of Multichain Uniswap 15, the Boba Foundation is proposing that the Uniswap community vote to authorize the deployment of Uniswap v3 to Boba Network.

Boba Network is a blockchain Layer 2 scaling solution and [Hybrid Compute](https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2022/07/boba-networks-hybrid-compute-why-it-will-unlock-blockchains-true-potential) platform offering lightning fast transactions and fees anywhere from 40-100x less than the respective Layer 1. Boba’s Hybrid Compute brings the power of Web2 on-chain, with smarter smart contracts that allow developers and creators to leverage off-chain compute and real-world data to offer an enriched experience unlike anything else on the market today.

In addition, Boba Network is the first and only [multichain ](https://www.theblock.co/post/149837/ethereum-layer-2-boba-network-integrates-with-fantom-and-moonbeam)Layer 2, deploying on leading Layer 1 chains such as Ethereum, Avalanche, BNB and Moonbeam. Deploying on Boba will expand the Uniswap community to include users of the Boba multichain ecosystem, helping Uniswap on its journey to become a leading product in the multichain world.

The timeline for deployment will be approximately 3-4 weeks following the Governance Proposal, with contract deployment being handled by the Boba Foundation.

## Proposal
There are many benefits for the Uniswap Protocol, some of which include:

Ethereum equivalence. Developer tools, resources, projects, and protocols supported by Ethereum are already supported on the Boba Network. A trustless bridge architecture to bridge assets from Ethereum to the Boba Network L2 has been in place since mainnet launch, with many bridging partners extending bridge capabilities, such as Across.to, Synapse, Multichain and Layerswap.

Low cost transactions with high security. As an Ethereum L2, Boba Network relies on Ethereum’s strong base layer security while providing very low cost transactions, with fees anywhere from 40-100x less than Ethereum.

## Details for Incentivized Adoption of Uniswap v3
Boba Foundation will provide $1M $BOBA tokens to foster the usage of Uniswap v3 on Boba Network. The tokens will be sent to a multisig wallet co-owned by the Uniswap Grants Program (UGP) and Boba Foundation, who will work to deploy the funds as follows:

The incentives should be designed together with other projects which are operating on top of Uniswap v3 such as ICHI, Perpetual Protocol, Paraswap, or 1inch. $BOBA can be used to incentivize liquidity but should not be limited to this use case. Anything increasing the usage of Uniswap v3 on Boba Network, including building new applications on top of Uniswap v3, should be supported. The goal is to deploy the $1M in the time period of one year. Funds not used after two years would go back to the Boba Foundation. The spending is limited to $1M - the transferred amount of $BOBA as part of the proposal. The Boba Foundation may increase this amount based on the outcome of this initiative. In addition to this, the Boba Foundation has already contributed more than $4M of liquidity on Uniswap v3 to bootstrap the initial success of Uniswap v3 on the Boba Network.

## Security
Boba Network is designed so that users can send arbitrary messages between smart contracts on L2 and L1. Users can relay messages themselves. The security of the messages passed is secured within the rollup protocol. Bridging and sequencing transactions is based on Optimism’s [Optimistic Rollup](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism) codebase. From L1 to L2, users need to trigger the CanonicalTransactionChain contract on L1 to create a new block on Boba Network. The Sequencer is then forced to include the transaction on L2. From L2 to L1: Making provable statements about the state of Boba requires a cryptographic commitment in the form of the root of the Boba’s state trie to a smart contract on L1 called the StateCommitmentChain. Updates of the state trie are regularly published. With Merkle tree proofs of the commitments, users can use these proofs to make verifiable statements about the data within the storage of any contract on Boba at a specific block height. This can then be used to enable contracts on Boba L2 to send messages to contracts on L1.

The bridge uses the security of the source chain (L1). In an Optimistic Rollup design, state commitments are published to L1 without any direct proof of the validity of these commitments. Instead, these commitments are considered pending for a period of time (called the “challenge window”). In the challenge window the commitment could be invalidated through a fraud proof. Fraud proof challenges are not enabled and there’s a single sequencer design currently in production. In the event of fraud, the malicious actor and the prover of fraud will (in the future) play out an interactive challenge game and the malicious actor will be slashed.

The Boba Network codebase and Optimism’s codebase have undergone multiple audits, with no outstanding vulnerabilities.

## Governance
To enable Ethereum’s Uniswap deployment to govern the Boba Network Ethereum L2 instance, Boba Network's Native Bridge will be used to transmit governance decisions from Ethereum L1 to the Boba Network Ethereum L2 instance of Uniswap V3. The Boba Foundation and community would like to thank the GFX Labs team for their attention and guidance through the process.

## License Exemption
The Boba Foundation is requesting an exemption that will allow the Licensed Work to be deployed on the Boba Network, a Layer 2 blockchain on Ethereum, provided that the deployment is subject to Ethereum Layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control.

# Description
**0xPlasma Labs** is submitting a Governance Proposal to deploy Uniswap v3 to BNB Chain on behalf of the Uniswap Community. The [temperature check](URL:https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0xa3c7247632d3a08e4e73a63867908d0cd4402f48fa673945f93e3197dee5450a) passed with **20M (80.28%) YES** votes and 4.9M (19.72%) NO votes. Here is a link to the [Proposal Discussion](URL:https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-update-deploy-uniswap-v3-1-0-3-0-05-0-01-on-bnb-chain-binance/19734) on Uniswap Governance Forum.

# Proposal
This proposal will authorize [0xPlasma Labs](URL:http://plasma.finance/) to deploy the [Uniswap v3 protocol](URL:https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core) to the BNB PoS Chain on behalf of the community. We believe this is the best moment for Uniswap v3 to deploy on BNB PoS Chain, for many reasons (one of them is License expiration).

## About BNB Chain
[BNB Chain](URL:https://bnbchain.org/) is a decentralized, public blockchain that operates using a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. It is designed to support the development and deployment of decentralized applications (dApps) and decentralized finance (DeFi) projects and is powered by the Binance Coin (BNB) token. BNB Chain is operated by Binance, a leading cryptocurrency exchange and blockchain technology company, but is open to participation and contributions from a global community of developers, users, and stakeholders.

1. BNB Chain has a large and growing user base, providing a potential new market for Uniswap v3.
2. BNB Chain offers high transaction speeds and low fees, making it a suitable platform for Uniswap’s decentralized exchange services.
3. Deploying to BNB Chain could help Uniswap to tap into the growing popularity of DeFi in the Binance ecosystem.
4. BNB Chain offers unique features such as staking and cross-chain support that could enhance Uniswap v3’s functionality.
5. BNB Chain’s strong governance model and active community could provide valuable support and feedback for the development of Uniswap v3.
6. Binance, the company behind BNB Chain, has a strong track record of supporting and promoting high-quality projects, potentially providing valuable exposure for Uniswap v3.
7. Binance has a global presence and a strong brand, which could help increase awareness and adoption of Uniswap v3 among retail and institutional investors.
8. Binance offers a range of products and services that could be integrated with Uniswap v3, such as the Binance Smart Chain and Binance DEX.
9. Deploying to BNB Chain could provide opportunities for collaboration and partnerships with other projects on the Binance ecosystem.
10. BNB Chain strongly focuses on security and compliance, providing a safe and trusted environment for Uniswap v3 to operate.
11. BNB Chain has a robust ecosystem of dApps and DeFi projects, providing potential opportunities for collaboration and co-development.
12. BNB Chain’s support for on-chain governance could enable Uniswap v3 to adopt a more decentralized and community-driven development model.
13. BNB Chain’s support for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) could enable Uniswap v3 to adopt a more decentralized and community-driven business model.
14. BNB Chain’s strong emphasis on community engagement and participation could provide valuable support and feedback for Uniswap v3.
15. BNB Chain’s commitment to regulatory compliance could provide valuable support for Uniswap v3 as it seeks to expand into new markets and jurisdictions.
16. BNB Chain’s support for tokenization and digital asset management could enable Uniswap v3 to offer new services and features for users.
17. BNB Chain’s a fast-developing ecosystem of decentralized finance dapps and assets.

> [DeFi Llama](URL:https://defillama.com/) has the overall TVL of DeFi at $49B, of which **$29B** is on Ethereum. The second largest is [BSC](URL:https://defillama.com/chain/BSC) at **$5B**. Pancake Swap has $2.35B in TVL. Dune reports BSC as having 753k weekly users. It is a significant number of users Uniswap should be pursuing.

## Security & Bridges
Since the [Temperature Check](URL:https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0xa3c7247632d3a08e4e73a63867908d0cd4402f48fa673945f93e3197dee5450a), we have discussed with stakeholders within the Uniswap ecosystem, who have expressed a desire to see trust-minimized bridges used for governance for the new Uniswap v3 deployment on BNB Chain. On the [Governance Forum](URL:https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-update-deploy-uniswap-v3-1-0-3-0-05-0-01-on-bnb-chain-binance/19734), teams presented several bridge solutions: [DeBridge](URL:https://debridge.finance/), [Celer](URL:https://www.celer.network/), [Wormhole](URL:https://wormhole.com/), [Layer Zero](URL:https://layerzero.network/). Based on the technical assessment of presented bridges by 0xPlasma Labs, GFXLabs, Uniswap Foundation and Uniswap community discussion, we've decided to move forward with another [Temperature Check](URL:https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0x6b8df360fdf73085b21fdf5eef9f85916fbde95621a3d454cb20fbe545ffc852) regarding Bridge Infrastructure for BNB Chain, where we listed all four candidates.

As a result of a very [complex discussion](URL:https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-update-deploy-uniswap-v3-1-0-3-0-05-0-01-on-bnb-chain-binance/19734) and voting on the [Snapshot](URL:https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0x6b8df360fdf73085b21fdf5eef9f85916fbde95621a3d454cb20fbe545ffc852), the community chose the [Wormhole](URL:https://wormhole.com/) bridge for the Uniswap v3 deployment on BNB Chain (**with 28M votes**), the second place in the vote was taken by the solution from the Layer Zero team (**17M votes**).

**Here is some major security characteristic of Wormhole bridge:**

1. **Does the bridge support arbitrary message passing?** Yes, Wormhole is one of the first and longest-serving arbitrary messaging protocols. Since launching on mainnet in August 2021, 185 million messages have been transmitted, with [2 million messages](URL:https://wormhole.com/stats/) currently generated daily between asset transfers and messaging through organic usage.
2. **Is the bridge secured by a trusted entity, by a multi-sig, or a protocol/set of incentivized nodes?** Wormhole is secured by 19 validators (aka: Guardians) who jointly attest to messages. Each message must be attested by at least 13 of the 19 Guardians. Our Guardian set comprises the leading PoS validators, including Staked, Figment, Chorus One, P2P, and more. The complete set of current validators can be found [here](URL:https://wormhole.com/network/). As mentioned above Wormhole is making significant progress in developing ZK-based light clients to facilitate completely trustless message-passing.
3. **Does the bridge leverage the security of the source chain (e.g. Ethereum L1) or destination chain, or is the security provided by another third-party entity?** Wormhole message security waits for both consensuses to be reached on the source chain as well as additional safety features provided by the bridge. Additionally, Guardians run full nodes to protect the protocol against consensus-level exploits in the connected chains and further reduce contagion risk.
4. **Is it possible for a fraudulent message to be passed to the destination chain? If so, are there any recall mechanisms?** All messages passing through Wormhole require a minimum of observation and signing by a majority of the Wormhole Guardian set (13 of 19). While there is currently no out-of-the-box recall mechanism for messages, a minority (7 of 19) Guardians may refuse to sign a fraudulent message and thwart an attack. Simple yet customized message recall functions can be built by individual integrators. An integrator would build “edge contracts” to introduce a time delay on message acceptance, providing an integrator with an opportunity to recall the message before it becomes effective.
5. **What are the ramifications of fraud to the malicious actor?** Wormhole’s Guardians are leading [PoS validators](URL:https://wormhole.com/network/) and some of the most respected names within the validator community. They collectively represent tens of billions in value staked and carry valuable reputations in the communities where they serve. Should they act maliciously (such as a sign or forge fraudulent messages), they risk reputational consequences, external PoS businesses, and ejection from the Wormhole Guardian set. There is little incentive for an individual Guardian to act maliciously. Even if a Guardian were to succeed in forging a fraudulent message, it would not affect the network state because a single signature isn’t enough to establish the super-majority required to gain a quorum. Finally, a fraudulent message would be immediately attributable to the offending Guardian to the rest of the Guardian network.
6. **Has the bridge code been audited? By a third party? What attack vectors and vulnerabilities were identified, if any? Have the identified vulnerabilities been remedied?** The bridge has been audited 25+ times by leading audit firms, including Certik, Trail of Bits, and OtterSec, and the cohort of auditors continues to grow. You can see the complete list of auditors and publicized findings [here](URL:https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole/blob/main/SECURITY.md#3rd-Party-Security-Audits). Those 25 audits are in addition to Wormhole’s already rigorous internal auditing standards, where a team of 6 experienced security engineers regularly perform reviews of the protocol’s security.

Bridge Infrastructure has a significant part in the multi-chain future of Uniswap v3. We received multiple offers from the biggest bridge providers during the proposal discussion. Uniswap Foundation launched a [discussion topic](URL:https://gov.uniswap.org/t/cross-chain-bridge-assessment-process/20148) on the forum for technical bridge assessments (The tentative deadline to provide feedback on the process below is **Friday, February 17th.**), while Celer Team has developed and provided a [multi-bridge contract](URL:https://gov.uniswap.org/t/cross-chain-bridge-assessment-process/20148/4?u=ilia_0x) with the support of multiple bridges (Celer, [DeBridge](URL:https://gov.uniswap.org/t/cross-chain-bridge-assessment-process/20148/9?u=ilia_0x), Wormhole). The [summary](URL:https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-update-deploy-uniswap-v3-1-0-3-0-05-0-01-on-bnb-chain-binance/19734/86?u=ilia_0x) of the current governance proposal progress.

> After the current Governance Proposal passes the voting and deployment on BNB Chain, we plan to continue our research and bridge assessment. As we will find out a new solution we will start a new proposal for updating the current bridge infrastructure.

## License Exemption
We are requesting an exemption via an Additional Use Grant (license change enacted via the ENS domain uniswap.eth) that would allow the 0xPlasma Labs to use the Licensed Work to deploy it on BNB Chain, a layer 1 EVM compatible blockchain, provided that the deployment is subject to Ethereum layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control. Uniswap V3 will be deployed on BNB Chain by the 0xPlasma Labs through the “[Deploy Uniswap V3 Script](URL:https://github.com/Uniswap/deploy-v3#deploy-uniswap-v3-script)” 0xPlasma Labs would be permitted to use subcontractors to do this work.

## Timeline
Following the Governance Proposal, [0xPlasma Labs](URL:https://plasma.finance/) will be ready to move forward with the Uniswap V3 deployment on BNB Chain immediately, using Wormhole bridge infrastructure for cross-chain governance messaging."

**By GFX Labs & ConsenSys**
## Rationale:

This proposal seeks to deploy a 1bp fee tier for UniswapV3 on Arbitrum. This will allow users to trade with lower fees, making it more accessible and competitive with other decentralized exchanges. The optionality of a 1bp fee tier is useful for stable-to-stable swapping and can often be found among the top ten liquidity pools on each of Uniswap’s respective deployments. 

Since the launch of the 1bp fee tier on mainnet, [Polygon](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/polygon-1bp-fee-tier/16488), and [Optimism](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/deploy-a-1bp-fee-tier-to-uniswapv3-on-optimism/16930), the 1bp fee tier has directly led to growth in Uniswap’s DEX market share and directly competes with stablecoin DEX protocols.

[Source](https://dune.com/1a1/DEX-Market-Share-for-Stablecoins)

Benefits:
* Lower fee tiers increase competitiveness and incentivize more user activity.
* As liquidity is more concentrated, 1bp pools are more capital efficient, especially for stable-to-stable swaps.
* Lower fee tiers can also lead to increased volume and earnings for liquidity providers.
## Why Arbitrum:
Favorable outcomes from deploying the 1bp fee tier on all other existing Uniswap v3 deployments make this an uncontroversial upgrade of the Arbitrum deployment.

Arbitrum has a thriving ecosystem of DeFi dapps that will benefit from less stable-to-stable friction. The Uniswap deployment on Arbitrum currently has [~200M of TVL and ~160M of volume](https://info.uniswap.org/#/arbitrum/). With Curve’s liquidity bribing mechanism losing efficiency, Uniswap is in a strong position to compete for traders’ flow and LPs’ liquidity by providing more competitive fee tiers.

## Summary

We [Blockchain at Michigan](https://twitter.com/UMichBlockchain) are submitting this [proposal](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/deploy-uniswap-v3-on-avalanche/20587) for initiating Uniswap v3 deployment on the Avalanche blockchain. With the BSL expiring on April 1st, the Uniswap Foundation has [stated](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/cross-chain-deployment-guide/19988?u=gfxlabs) the importance of Uniswap v3 expansion to popular EVM chains. Establishing Uniswap on alt L1s–and not just on Ethereum L2s–is vital for establishing a robust, multichain future. After consulting with the Ava Labs team, we believe that this is a crucial and opportune time for Uniswap to expand to Avalanche’s growing ecosystem.

The [temperature check passed](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0xa47404722b9c8a6fb850cf5de79e8a95f073f06393290949644a627bfe85bced) with **26M (91.26%) YES** votes and **2.5M (8.74%) NO** votes.

## Proposal Motivation

The primary urgency behind this proposal is the upcoming BSL expiration on April 1st. As soon as the license expires, all entities will have the legal right to duplicate Uniswap v3 and utilize the forked code for commercial purposes. Invariably, large chains like Avalanche will see a rapid influx of v3 copycats, which will dilute the markets on those respective chains. It is therefore imperative for Uniswap v3 to get ahead of the competitors by launching on large chains before duplicates arise. Trader Joe v2, the current leading DEX on Avalanche, did [$92.45M](https://defillama.com/dexs/chains/avalanche) of volume in the past 24 hours (Feb 23)–indicative of the demand for a concentrated liquidity AMM. Due to the continual growth of the Avalanche ecosystem, along with the liquidity present on the platform, we believe that this proposal be enacted as soon as possible to ensure that Uniswap establishes a foothold in the Avalanche DEX market.

We realize that beyond the chain of deployment, the community must also consider the required cross-chain messaging protocol. Although the DAO previously coalesced to utilize [Wormhole for the BNB Chain deployment](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0x6b8df360fdf73085b21fdf5eef9f85916fbde95621a3d454cb20fbe545ffc852), we believe that such a decision should not set a precedent for bridge selection. A vendor lock-in model would prevent the further testing of equally renowned messaging protocols like LayerZero. A handful of delegates and tokenholders have also pioneered a more novel approach to governance messaging, where cross-chain governance relies not on a single bridge but simultaneously on a handful of bridges. Although we see the merits of a [multi-bridge system](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/cross-chain-bridge-assessment-process/20148/1), it will take time for this approach to garner attention and be fully vetted. The DAO can decide to opt into a multi bridge system in the future–but for an agile deployment that can be implemented in the present, we believe that LayerZero is the best solution.

## Current State of Avalanche
Avalanche is a blockchain platform that utilizes three separate blockchains, the Platform Chain (P-Chain), Contract Chain (C-Chain), and Exchange Chain (X-Chain), to improve scalability and interoperability. These three chains compose a consortium of validators called the Primary Network, which is responsible for Avalanche’s security.

Avalanche operates with the Avalanche consensus algorithm, which is designed to be more efficient than alternative consensus mechanisms and enables EVM-compatibility. The consensus mechanism checks validators’ transaction confirmations randomly by allowing all nodes to work in parallel, increasing the probability that a transaction is valid. The C-Chain leverages the Snowman consensus protocol, which mimics Avalanche consensus but is optimized for smart contract integration. Therefore, most Avalanche dAPP activity currently transpires on the C-chain. 

In comparison to other smart contract platforms, Avalanche touts 2-second time-to-finality, faster than any of its peers (ex. Ethereum finality is 10 minutes). Uniswap on Avalanche would thereby enhance the user experience for both application users and liquidity providers. 

Avalanche also allows for an unbounded number of validators without sacrificing block time. This allows for an increasing degree of decentralization over time. In Q4 2022, the platform’s [Nakamoto coefficient increased from 30 to 32](https://nakaflow.io/)–surpassing most other L1s–and is poised to continue in an upward direction. Currently, there are [1,228 validators](https://www.avax.network/validators) and over [233M AVAX tokens staked](https://www.avax.network/validators). The expanding validator set and staked AVAX tokens exemplify a robust L1.

The Avalanche architecture permits a high degree of scalability through its ecosystem of subnets. Similar to Ethereum’s L2s, subnets allow for outsourcing blockspace from the Primary Network to alternative blockchains. Application-specific blockchains can be launched under customized subnets, granting builders control over their development stack (subnets specify their own execution logic, fee regime, state, networking, and security). Large protocols that initially relied on the C-Chain, like DFK and StepNetwork, are now migrating to their individualized subnets. The increase in subnets furthers the security of Avalanche since each subnet’s validators must simultaneously secure the Primary Network.

Increased application activity on the C-Chain and subnets presents Avalanche as an expanding ecosystem. At the time of writing, according to [DeFi Llama](https://defillama.com/chains), Avalanche holds over $950M of TVL across 281 different protocols.

Since launching in Q3 2020, Avalanche’s txn count has cumulatively increased to nearly [700M](https://avascan.info/). Messari reported that between Nov 2021 - Nov 2022 alone, the network experienced [YoY txn growth of 1,507%](https://research.nansen.ai/article/529/avalanche-scaling-with-subnets). Although [daily active users remained relatively steady since Summer 2022](https://tokenterminal.com/terminal/projects/avalanche), average daily transactions increased from ~1M to ~3M, indicating the emergence of power users. A reliable user base is imperative for a properly functioning Uniswap protocol. The presence of long-term liquidity provision would aid in bootstrapping individual subnets as well as making the C-Chain more robust.

Post deployment, the most fierce competitor for Uni v3 will be Trader Joe. Since Trader Joe recently released a Uni v3-like, [capital efficient AMM](https://docs.traderjoexyz.com/), Uniswap has an incentive to capture as much of Avalanche’s DEX market prior to Trader Joe v2 locking in a concrete user base. Plus, after the BSL expires in April, numerous Uni v3 forks will invariably launch on Avalanche. Therefore, to minimize Uniswap’s dilution in the Avalanche ecosystem, the DAO is incentivized to launch v3 as soon as possible.

Due to Uniswap’s strong brand, it has the ability to capture market share from existing DEXs and attract liquidity from new users. A notable historical anecdote is Polygon. Once Uni v3 launched on Polygon, it quickly acquired market share from both Quickswap and Sushiswap. Although this experiment is yet to be tested on an alt L1, it is likely that a similar pattern will surface on Avalanche–although Trader Joe may present a higher degree of friction. Nonetheless, it is not necessary that the DEX competition will result in a zero-sum game and can favor both Trader Joe and Uniswap simultaneously. 

Apart from DeFi developments, Avalanche has also made strides in other sectors like gaming, NFTs, and user adoption. Further facilitation of each of these categories is enabled by a DEX like Uniswap. And in turn, Uniswap liquidity providers–and maybe token holders–will attain economic value from the protocol’s increased usage. 

## Safety and Cross-Chain Governance

### LayerZero Overview
We propose using LayerZero, an omnichain bridging solution, to facilitate cross-chain message passing between Ethereum and Avalanche. LayerZero has pre-existing support for both Avalanche and Ethereum.

The [first use case of Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) transfer](https://medium.com/avalancheavax/layerzero-aims-to-create-one-unified-experience-for-btc-b-339eb4d23672) has been active for nearly 4 months on Avalanche. LayerZero allows Avalanche BTC (BTC.b) bridging between all LayerZero-supported chains, creating a composable, unified liquidity system for BTC. From the 25+ supported chains, two, DFK and Swimmer, are run as their own subnets. Apart from cross-chain asset transferring, LayerZero also supports arbitrary message passing–which includes governance communication between Uniswap on Ethereum to Avalanche.

LayerZero is backed by the likes of a16z, Sequoia, Uniswap Labs, Coinbase, and numerous others–it is supported by thousands of cross-chain builders with over 2,000 contracts deployed on mainnet, ~700 unique applications, ~2M total messages, ~$5B transactional volume, and billions of dollars in TVL.

**Is the bridge secured by a trusted entity, by a multi sig, or a protocol/set of incentivized nodes?**
LayerZero endpoints rely on an architecture leveraging Ultra Light Nodes and two off-chain entities called oracles and relayers to securely relay messages between endpoints on a source and destination chain. The oracle is responsible for relaying block headers, and with the default LayerZero setup, will be handled by Chainlink. A transaction proof is sent using the relayer; the default relayer is operated by LayerZero. Hence, the security of the system relies on 2 entities. The primary assumption behind this setup is that the oracle and relayer remain independent at all times. Collusion between the entities would lead to a compromised system. Uniswap will have the option to operate one or both of these entities which would decrease the possibility of collusion.

**Is the bridge secured by a trusted entity, by a multi sig, or a protocol/set of incentivized nodes?**
LayerZero leverages direct MPT validation construction of the source transaction and verifies the merkle inclusion proof directly on the destination chain via the protocol’s novel Ultra Light Node (ULN).

**Is it possible for a fraudulent message to be passed to the destination chain? If so, are there any recall mechanisms?**
Malicious message transmission is a possibility if there is a compromise of both the oracle and relayer sets. Both entities would have to agree to approve a fraudulent message together and against the same application. For example, the decentralized Chainlink DON would have to actively collude with the LayerZero Labs relayer at the same time to enable passing of a malicious message. If the application selects multiple oracles and multiple relayers, thereby pricing its security higher, fraudulent message passing would require more independent parties to be simultaneously compromised.

**What are the ramifications of fraud to the malicious actor?**
Unlike some other bridges, LayerZero does not pose an economic stake or bond to punish malicious actors via a slashing mechanism. Instead, if the default oracle-relayer configuration is compromised, then there is a reputational backlash that would beset LayerZero and Chainlink–since they are the entities responsible for the relayer and oracle, respectively. However, if Uniswap decides to control the messaging stack by running either the oracle or relayer, then Uniswap itself will have to answer for its shortcomings if there happens to be malicious activity.

LayerZero is also designed to be censorship resistant. Oracles and Relayers cannot censor messages without censoring all messages due to the sequential nonce ordered enforcement on the receiving chain. As a result, if an attacker obtained control of the Uniswap-selected Oracles or Relayers, and succeeded in censoring a message, every subsequent message would also be censored and the vote would stop. Uniswap could then expediently resolve the issue by updating configurations and messaging would resume.

**Has the bridge code been audited? By a third party? What attack vectors and vulnerabilities were identified, if any? Have the identified vulnerabilities been remedied?**
Immutability is part and parcel to LayerZero’s infrastructure. Its smart contracts are not upgradable and therefore aren’t prone to bugs due to smart contract updates. Smart contract bugs is the predominant historical cause for bridge exploits, as was the case with Wormhole’s $300M and Nomad’s $190M hack in 2022. To ensure that the current LayerZero contracts are reliable enough to be set in stone and entirely independent from LayerZero Labs’ future involvements, the protocol has been [audited 35+ times](https://github.com/LayerZero-Labs/Audits) and reviewed at least 3+ times by the LayerZero Labs team.

LayerZero is the only major cross-chain messaging protocol to have secured significant transaction volume (~$5B) over time without any exploit, compromise of key infrastructure, or loss of user funds. Additionally, LayerZero has the [largest live bug bounty across the industry at up to $15M](https://medium.com/layerzero-official/layerzero-security-update-april-2022-4c27a22380b4).

### Future Bridge Alterations
Following deployment, if Uniswap governance would like to switch to a different bridge setup, the DAO can do so with a future proposal. There are current ruminations regarding a multi bridge messaging setup–but that is too early to implement for this proposal. Much like the recent BNB Chain deployment proposal, we recommend utilizing a single bridge for the time being and integrating a more novel system later on after the BSL expiration. 

## License Exemption
We are requesting an exemption via an Additional Use Grant (license change enacted via the ENS domain uniswap.eth) that would allow LayerZero to use the Licensed Work to deploy it on Avalanche, provided that the deployment is subject to Ethereum layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control. Uniswap v3 will be deployed on Avalanche by LayerZero Labs through the “[Deploy Uniswap V3 Script](https://github.com/Uniswap/deploy-v3#deploy-uniswap-v3-script)”. LayerZero Labs would be permitted to use subcontractors to do this work.

## Timeline
Once the on-chain governance proposal is completed, LayerZero Labs will deploy the Uniswap v3 smart contracts on the Avalanche C-Chain. Uniswap Labs will handle the front-end integration updates and include Avalanche to the auto router. Altogether, this deployment will take ~5 weeks to complete."

Point of Contact: Jack Melnick,

# Proposal summary
## Uniswap V3 launch on Polygon zkEVM.

### Overview of proposal
We propose to authorize Polygon Labs to deploy Uniswap’s protocol to the Polygon Zero Knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine rollup known as “zkEVM” on behalf of the community.

We believe this is the right moment for Uniswap v3 to deploy on Polygon zkEVM, for several major reasons:

* Polygon zkEVM is a new zk-rollup that provides Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) equivalence (opcode-level compatibility) for a transparent user experience and existing Ethereum ecosystem and tooling compatibility.
* An Ethereum L2 scalability solution utilizing cryptographic zero-knowledge technology to provide validation and fast finality of off-chain transaction computations.
* A new set of tools and technologies were created and engineered and are contained in this organization, to address the required recreation of all EVM opcodes for transparent deployment and transactions with existing Ethereum smart contracts.
* Polygon is aligned with Ethereum and its values.

### About Polygon Labs

Polygon Labs is the leading platform for Ethereum scaling and infrastructure development. It is rapidly building a suite of protocols that will offer developers easy access to all major scaling and infrastructure solutions:

- L2 solutions/Rollups (Polygon Hermez 2, Polygon Miden 2);
- Sidechains, stand-alone and enterprise chains (Polygon SDK 1);
- Hybrid solutions (Polygon PoS);
- Data availability solutions (Polygon Avail 2) and more.

The Polygon network is by far the most adopted scaling effort in the Ethereum ecosystem, with 3,000+ applications hosted, 1B+ transactions processed, 100M+ unique user addresses and ~$5B+ in assets secured.

### Motivation
There’s significant value in Uniswap being available on an EVM compatible ZK rollup. Deploying early on zkEVM helps solidify Uniswap’s place as the number one DEX and a thought leader.

Importantly, it will help grow a large list of projects that can be built on Uniswap V3. Additionally, given the community and user uptake Uniswap has seen on Polygon PoS, it’s only natural to make its deployment on Polygon zkEVM a priority.

## Partner Details
### Polygon Labs

This proposal is being made by Jack Melnick, DeFi BD Lead, an employee of Polygon Labs. Polygon Labs is a legal entity focused on the ecosystem growth and maintenance of the suite of Polygon Networks.

### Partner Legal

The legal entity that is supporting this proposal is Polygon Labs Services (Switzerland) AG, a Swiss corporation known as “Polygon Labs”.

### Delegate Sponsor

There is no delegate co-authoring or sponsoring this proposal. Instead, this is a proposal submitted by Jack Melnick of Polygon Labs to support the growth of Polygon as part of the overall Polygon community.

### Conflict of Interest Declaration

There are no existing financial or contractual relationships between Polygon Labs and any of Uniswap’s legal entities, including Uniswap Labs, UNI tokens, nor investments of Uniswap Labs Ventures.

## KPI & Success Criteria

### Target KPIs
There are generally 2 forms of projects:

1) Growth-driven projects: on-chain, trackable metrics preferred here.

2) Strategic Initiatives: that targets a specific goal (e.g. Uniswap Foundation core initiatives). These are more completion based.

![cb3bb480aa0a9ae1b520f73a0e0c16654f8f9e33.png](ipfs://bafkreidivzmticu723vvql57p6suqwurkd3lekjmfsbspy3h72pjn4ul6u)
 
### What does success look like?

Success Criteria: A successful zkEVM deployment will, in an organic and sustained manner, grow Uniswap’s Total Addressable Market across TVL, unique interacting wallet, volumes, and integration with partner dApps. As demand for zk-blockchains and proximity to Ethereum rises, users and builders will increasingly look to zkEVM solutions to build and trade.

### What potential risks are there for this project’s success? How could they be mitigated?

Risk Profile: Deploying on zkEVM should pose minimal risks, relative to deploying on alternate blockchains. As an Ethereum Layer Two, it uses Zero Knowledge proofs to inherit Ethereum’s core safety, while allowing developers to easily deploy existing EVM codebases. 

The bridge has been disintermediated, and Uniswap can expect reputable Oracle providers to be available as data providers from Day One. Polygon’s zkEVM testnet has been running for the past six months, and has accumulated over 84,000 wallets, 75,000 ZK proofs, and 300,000 blocks. Additionally, the deployment has been audited multiple times, by auditors including Spearbit and Hexens. 

Primary risks, as always, include still unforeseen vectors, which can be mitigated through close work with Polygon developer support (whenever needed) and gradual deployment of liquidity on the new chain.

### Protocol security
Please address the following questions if you’re proposing a cross-chain deployment:

**Does the bridge support arbitrary message passing?** Yes

**Is the bridge secured by a trusted entity, by a multi sig, or a protocol/set of incentivized nodes?** No trusted entity, multi-sig, or a protocol/set of incentivized nodes, only L1 and L2 security. Pure smart contract interactions only.

**Does the bridge leverage the security of the source chain (e.g. Ethereum L1) or destination chain, or is security provided by another third party entity?** All based on L1 and L2. L2 security is based on the L1.

**Is it possible for a fraudulent message to be passed to the destination chain? If so, are there any recall mechanisms?** There are two ways to use the bridge:
- Native supported messages: Allow only bridging of ERC-20 and ETH. Here there is nothing someone can do other than that.
- Custom Messages: Custom receiver logic on the other side of the bridge. When you send a message the message needs to be received by a smart contract, so you have to build the receiver smart contract, which is specific to the logic of that smart contract. Here the security is up to the person building the receiver smart contract. These custom messages do not take custody of any funds. All we guarantee is that the message will pass the bridge if implemented correctly. We are just the message carrier.

**What are the ramifications of fraud to the malicious actor?** Here we assume no possibility for fraud.

**Has the bridge code been audited? By a third party? What attack vectors and vulnerabilities were identified, if any? Have the identified vulnerabilities been remedied?** There is an ongoing audit process by a third party. We will not go to Mainnet without the results from the audit and vulnerabilities remedied."

Blockchain@Columbia and the Gnosis team are submitting an on-chain proposal to deploy Uniswap V3 to Gnosis Chain. With Uniswap V3's BSL expired on April 1st, deployment of Uniswap V3 on alt-L1's is crucial for Uniswap to establish market share post license expiry. After consultation with both the Gnosis and Wormhole teams, we think that it's crucial to deploy Uni V3 on Gnosis chain now as a step towards a multichain future.

The [temperature check](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0x63f6c44e4245e5b90a0f30ebb6932506879f68b149a5f78fd2186125c9144535) passed with 20M (100%) YES votes and 508 UNI (0%) NO votes.

## Proposal Motivation

This proposal has already been in discussion since April 2022, where it has passed both a snapshot check and temperature check with overwhelming support. Unfortunately, due to the Nomad bridge incident, deployment was put on hold. The Gnosis team has continued to work and push this proposal throughout this time and we believe that it's fair for their work to come into fruition after a year.

With the recent BSL expiry, this proposal comes at a crucial time. Expectedly, protocols will harp on this opportunity and use the same V3 design to extract value in ecosystems where Uniswap is absent. As such, we believe that it is important for Uniswap to capture this opportunity prior to the license expiration date before forks (which may or may not be safe) arise.

Additionally, Uniswap deployment on GC will be mutually beneficial for a number of reasons:

1. With Uniswap v3 as a cornerstone DeFi engine, various protocols will have the opportunity to interact within the ecosystem, further promoting growth. Perpetual Protocol, the flagship protocol on Gnosis Chanin, relies on Uniswap v3 and this deployment will enable Perpetual to continue to flourish on Gnosis Chain. Other bluechip deployments including Curve, Balancer, and Sushi have also chosen Gnosis as their home bases and shown steady growth in TVL. Complete metrics of Gnosis Chain are available at <https://defillama.com/chain/Gnosis>. Many new protocols will soon be deployed on Gnosis and we believe that Uniswap can be at the forefront of the next wave of DeFi on GC.

2. Gnosis Chain's ability to offer stable, low-cost transactions are directly beneficial to Uniswap users. With low gas costs that don't impact swaps and trades, GC can offer users the ability to deploy efficient strategies at a higher volume, generating more fees -- an opportunity not available on Ethereum mainnet.

3. Gnosis can provide an iterative environment where Uniswap Labs can experiment with new functionalities and front-run new features. Unlike a test environment, a real value environment like GC allows for a more accurate evaluation of the platform's capabilities. This also provides an opportunity for uniswap to identify and address any potential issues stemming from important Ethereum updates before their mainnet activation. With optimized slot and epoch times, Uniswap can ensure faster iteration and improve the overall efficiency of the platform.

4. Deploying Uniswap on Gnosis Chain ensures tight compatibility with Ethereum. GC currently supports various tools, resources, projects, and protocols that are already supported by Ethereum, with more being onboarded regularly. A full list of protocols on GC is available at <https://gnosischain.world/>. Many existing projects are using Gnosis Safe for their daily operations. The Gnosis team is also working on a [trustless bridge architecture](https://hackmd.io/g8TK7IzYQjClTTaor-ypIQ) that will connect Ethereum and GC, providing seamless interoperability between the two chains. The [Gnosis Beacon Chain validator set](https://beacon.gnosischain.com/) is expanding rapidly with 113,665 active validators at the moment, bringing massive decentralization to the chain. While the GBC shares many similarities with the Ethereum Beacon Chain, there are some notable differences. Notably, GBC has 5-second blocks and < 2-min epochs, which allow for faster transactions and has a lower gas target of $.01 per 100k gas, providing stable transactions. The validator set is economically and geographically diverse, ensuring greater decentralization with lower-stakes, lower-TVL environment.

5. The Gnosis Chain's unique characteristics such as stable, low-cost transactions offer significant advantages to Uniswap users. With predictable and low gas costs, traders can explore new strategies and approaches that may not be feasible on other chains with variable and high fees, such as the Ethereum mainnet. This presents an opportunity for Uniswap users to optimize their trades and maximize their returns, ultimately enhancing the overall user experience.

6. Gnosis Chain is committed to increasing their user base and on-chain activity by providing user incentives. To achieve this goal, GC has established an ecosystem fund that is strategically allocated from the GnosisDAO treasury to promote adoption. As part of our joint proposal, we suggest utilizing a portion of these funds to promote Uniswap v3 adoption. This initiative will encourage users to trade and stake their assets, ultimately promoting greater liquidity and activity on the platform. Through this program, we aim to attract more users and establish Uniswap as a leading DeFi protocol on the platform.

## Security & Bridges

This section is from 0xPlasma Labs' [proposal](https://app.uniswap.org/#/vote/2/31) regarding Uniswap V3 deployment on BNB chain. As Wormhole is our bridge provider of choice for Gnosis deployment, their analysis is of utmost relevance for this proposal. Given that Wormhole has been chosen for BNB deployment, they already have the necessary resources to make deployment on Gnosis chain fast and efficient.

1. Does the bridge support arbitrary message passing? Yes, Wormhole is one of the first and longest-serving arbitrary messaging protocols. Since launching on mainnet in August 2021, 185 million messages have been transmitted, with 2 million messages currently generated daily between asset transfers and messaging through organic usage.

2. Is the bridge secured by a trusted entity, by a multi-sig, or a protocol/set of incentivized nodes? Wormhole is secured by 19 validators (aka: Guardians) who jointly attest to messages. Each message must be attested by at least 13 of the 19 Guardians. Our Guardian set comprises the leading PoS validators, including Staked, Figment, Chorus One, P2P, and more. The complete set of current validators can be found [here](https://wormhole.com/network/). As mentioned above Wormhole is making significant progress in developing ZK-based light clients to facilitate completely trustless message-passing.

3. Does the bridge leverage the security of the source chain (e.g. Ethereum L1) or destination chain, or is the security provided by another third-party entity? Wormhole message security waits for both consensuses to be reached on the source chain as well as additional safety features provided by the bridge. Additionally, Guardians run full nodes to protect the protocol against consensus-level exploits in the connected chains and further reduce contagion risk.

4. Is it possible for a fraudulent message to be passed to the destination chain? If so, are there any recall mechanisms? All messages passing through Wormhole require a minimum of observation and signing by a majority of the Wormhole Guardian set (13 of 19). While there is currently no out-of-the-box recall mechanism for messages, a minority (7 of 19) Guardians may refuse to sign a fraudulent message and thwart an attack. Simple yet customized message recall functions can be built by individual integrators. An integrator would build ""edge contracts"" to introduce a time delay on message acceptance, providing an integrator with an opportunity to recall the message before it becomes effective.

5. What are the ramifications of fraud to the malicious actor? Wormhole's Guardians are leading PoS validators and some of the most respected names within the validator community. They collectively represent tens of billions in value staked and carry valuable reputations in the communities where they serve. Should they act maliciously (such as a sign or forge fraudulent messages), they risk reputational consequences, external PoS businesses, and ejection from the Wormhole Guardian set. There is little incentive for an individual Guardian to act maliciously. Even if a Guardian were to succeed in forging a fraudulent message, it would not affect the network state because a single signature isn't enough to establish the super-majority required to gain a quorum. Finally, a fraudulent message would be immediately attributable to the offending Guardian to the rest of the Guardian network.

6. Has the bridge code been audited? By a third party? What attack vectors and vulnerabilities were identified, if any? Have the identified vulnerabilities been remedied? The bridge has been audited 25+ times by leading audit firms, including Certik, Trail of Bits, and OtterSec, and the cohort of auditors continues to grow. You can see the complete list of auditors and publicized findings [here](https://wormhole.com/security/). Those 25 audits are in addition to Wormhole's already rigorous internal auditing standards, where a team of 6 experienced security engineers regularly perform reviews of the protocol's security.

## Future Bridge Alterations

Blockchain@Columbia and the Gnosis team support changes to this setup. When a more efficient design is finalized, multi-chain deployment design should be altered with said solution through governance.

## Timeline

Granted that the on-chain vote is approved, Uniswap V3 deployment on Gnosis chain will be ready for deployment through Wormhole's cross-chain messaging service. We estimate that the backend of the deployment can be completed within a few days.

With low gas costs that don't impact swaps and trades, GC can offer users the ability to deploy efficient strategies at a higher volume, generating more fees -- an opportunity not available on Ethereum mainnet.

3. Gnosis can provide an iterative environment where Uniswap Labs can experiment with new functionalities and front-run new features. Unlike a test environment, a real value environment like GC allows for a more accurate evaluation of the platform's capabilities. This also provides an opportunity for uniswap to identify and address any potential issues stemming from important Ethereum updates before their mainnet activation. With optimized slot and epoch times, Uniswap can ensure faster iteration and improve the overall efficiency of the platform.

4. Deploying Uniswap on Gnosis Chain ensures tight compatibility with Ethereum. GC currently supports various tools, resources, projects, and protocols that are already supported by Ethereum, with more being onboarded regularly. A full list of protocols on GC is available at <https://gnosischain.world/>. Many existing projects are using Gnosis Safe for their daily operations. The Gnosis team is also working on a [trustless bridge architecture](https://hackmd.io/g8TK7IzYQjClTTaor-ypIQ) that will connect Ethereum and GC, providing seamless interoperability between the two chains. The [Gnosis Beacon Chain validator set](https://beacon.gnosischain.com/) is expanding rapidly with 113,665 active validators at the moment, bringing massive decentralization to the chain. While the GBC shares many similarities with the Ethereum Beacon Chain, there are some notable differences. Notably, GBC has 5-second blocks and < 2-min epochs, which allow for faster transactions and has a lower gas target of $.01 per 100k gas, providing stable transactions. The validator set is economically and geographically diverse, ensuring greater decentralization with lower-stakes, lower-TVL environment.

5. The Gnosis Chain's unique characteristics such as stable, low-cost transactions offer significant advantages to Uniswap users. With predictable and low gas costs, traders can explore new strategies and approaches that may not be feasible on other chains with variable and high fees, such as the Ethereum mainnet. This presents an opportunity for Uniswap users to optimize their trades and maximize their returns, ultimately enhancing the overall user experience.

6. Gnosis Chain is committed to increasing their user base and on-chain activity by providing user incentives. To achieve this goal, GC has established an ecosystem fund that is strategically allocated from the GnosisDAO treasury to promote adoption. As part of our joint proposal, we suggest utilizing a portion of these funds to promote Uniswap v3 adoption. This initiative will encourage users to trade and stake their assets, ultimately promoting greater liquidity and activity on the platform. Through this program, we aim to attract more users and establish Uniswap as a leading DeFi protocol on the platform.

## Security & Bridges

This section is from 0xPlasma Labs' [proposal](https://app.uniswap.org/#/vote/2/31) regarding Uniswap V3 deployment on BNB chain. As Wormhole is our bridge provider of choice for Gnosis deployment, their analysis is of utmost relevance for this proposal. Given that Wormhole has been chosen for BNB deployment, they already have the necessary resources to make deployment on Gnosis chain fast and efficient.

1. Does the bridge support arbitrary message passing? Yes, Wormhole is one of the first and longest-serving arbitrary messaging protocols. Since launching on mainnet in August 2021, 185 million messages have been transmitted, with 2 million messages currently generated daily between asset transfers and messaging through organic usage.

2. Is the bridge secured by a trusted entity, by a multi-sig, or a protocol/set of incentivized nodes? Wormhole is secured by 19 validators (aka: Guardians) who jointly attest to messages. Each message must be attested by at least 13 of the 19 Guardians. Our Guardian set comprises the leading PoS validators, including Staked, Figment, Chorus One, P2P, and more. The complete set of current validators can be found [here](https://wormhole.com/network/). As mentioned above Wormhole is making significant progress in developing ZK-based light clients to facilitate completely trustless message-passing.

3. Does the bridge leverage the security of the source chain (e.g. Ethereum L1) or destination chain, or is the security provided by another third-party entity? Wormhole message security waits for both consensuses to be reached on the source chain as well as additional safety features provided by the bridge. Additionally, Guardians run full nodes to protect the protocol against consensus-level exploits in the connected chains and further reduce contagion risk.

4. Is it possible for a fraudulent message to be passed to the destination chain? If so, are there any recall mechanisms? All messages passing through Wormhole require a minimum of observation and signing by a majority of the Wormhole Guardian set (13 of 19). While there is currently no out-of-the-box recall mechanism for messages, a minority (7 of 19) Guardians may refuse to sign a fraudulent message and thwart an attack. Simple yet customized message recall functions can be built by individual integrators. An integrator would build ""edge contracts"" to introduce a time delay on message acceptance, providing an integrator with an opportunity to recall the message before it becomes effective.

5. What are the ramifications of fraud to the malicious actor? Wormhole's Guardians are leading PoS validators and some of the most respected names within the validator community. They collectively represent tens of billions in value staked and carry valuable reputations in the communities where they serve. Should they act maliciously (such as a sign or forge fraudulent messages), they risk reputational consequences, external PoS businesses, and ejection from the Wormhole Guardian set. There is little incentive for an individual Guardian to act maliciously. Even if a Guardian were to succeed in forging a fraudulent message, it would not affect the network state because a single signature isn't enough to establish the super-majority required to gain a quorum. Finally, a fraudulent message would be immediately attributable to the offending Guardian to the rest of the Guardian network.

6. Has the bridge code been audited? By a third party? What attack vectors and vulnerabilities were identified, if any? Have the identified vulnerabilities been remedied? The bridge has been audited 25+ times by leading audit firms, including Certik, Trail of Bits, and OtterSec, and the cohort of auditors continues to grow. You can see the complete list of auditors and publicized findings [here](https://wormhole.com/security/). Those 25 audits are in addition to Wormhole's already rigorous internal auditing standards, where a team of 6 experienced security engineers regularly perform reviews of the protocol's security.

## Future Bridge Alterations

Blockchain@Columbia and the Gnosis team support changes to this setup. When a more efficient design is finalized, multi-chain deployment design should be altered with said solution through governance.

## Timeline

Granted that the on-chain vote is approved, Uniswap V3 deployment on Gnosis chain will be ready for deployment through Wormhole's cross-chain messaging service. We estimate that the backend of the deployment can be completed within a few days.

This post follows the [RFC](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-accountability-committee-proposal/20316/16) and approved [Temperature Check](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-accountability-committee-proposal/20579/6) for the creation of an **Accountability Committee for Deployments** for Uniswap DAO.  

The main changes from the previous proposal are:

- The committee’s **Operating Policies** and **Conflict of Interest Policy** are listed below.
- Cameron O’Donnell (Consensys) has stepped down from the committee, and Rafael Solari (Tally) has stepped up to replace him.
- The proposal overview is updated to account for the committee’s role following the expiry of the Business Source License.

### Proposal Overview

We propose the creation of an **Accountability Committee for Deployments** tasked with overseeing the operational development of deployments of Uniswap V3 on other chains. 

Licensure and deployments are the areas that have generated the most governance activity. The continued launch of new chains and platforms will require ongoing oversight and attention.

************************************License Expiry & the Accountability Committee************************************

With the expiry of Uniswap’s BSL on April 1, 2023, prospective deployers will no longer require license exemptions voted on by Uniswap Governance. Teams wishing to utilize parts of Uniswap V3 may deploy at their own will. However, in order to be considered a part of Uniswap ecosystem, some projects will seek to obtain the “official” blessing and management of Uniswap Governance.

The initial purview of the proposed Committee will be to liaise with projects seeking to deploy Uniswap; ensure deploying projects are correctly configured; and providing a recommendation to the community on whether to approve certain deployments.


### Overview

Over the past year, several projects have requested Additional Use Grants to the Uniswap community and/or requested permission to deploy Uniswap protocol to alternative chains (including L2s and alternative L1s). Often such proposals offered financial incentives for Uniswap. However, the delivery of funds has been in some cases delayed or implemented according to mechanisms that weren’t part of the agreement terms. 

In order to mitigate this issue and facilitate stronger accountability practices in Uniswap, we propose the formation of an Accountability Committee tasked with the following functions:

- Be responsible for the evaluation of proposals during the first two phases of the governance process (RFC and Temperature Check).
- Verify that proposals comply with the requirements of the [Uniswap DAO Proposal Template](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/proposal-template-2-0-upgrade-for-deployments-agreements/19936).
- Implement and manage an on-chain commitment mechanism for Uniswap DAO.
- Require that deployment proposals offering financial incentives to Uniswap (including but not limited to grants for Uniswap community, liquidity mining, or metagovernance incentives) may not proceed forward to the last stage of the governance process without depositing a % of the promised funds into the commitment contract or other holding mechanisms.
- If the proposal does not follow the approval process, the committee will formally and publicly object to it.
- Provide last-mile QA and technical guidance for deployment configuration.
- Keeping track of commitments, disbursements, and project milestones.
- Report quarterly to Uniswap DAO on activities.

For each proposal that advances to the on-chain Governance Proposal phase, the Committee will engage in the following activities:

- Ensuring deployments are properly configured
- Liaising with the proposer team
- Facilitate delegate discussion around quality and credibility of the project
- Co-editing the final proposal with the proposer team 

  
### Committee Duration

The initial Committee will have ******************5 members****************** and a duration of **6 months** to allow committee members to begin developing practices and processes that may meaningfully carry forward into future iterations of the committee. 

With the expiration of BSL on April 1, 2023, the Committee’s core focus will be correct configuration of deployment and providing recommendation to governance on deployments that may be managed by Uniswap Governance. At the end of the term the Committee will be subjected to review by the community to discuss areas of improvement and potential expansion of its scope to other kinds of partnerships beyond deployments.

We believe that there is plenty of scope for the committee to keep providing value to Uniswap community after the expiration of the BSL:

- Cross-chain governance will continue to be an issue after April 1 and the committee will be in a position to provide expert guidance and recommendations in the process, while gathering community feedback, guaranteeing compliance to the [Cross-chain Assessment Bridge Process](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/cross-chain-bridge-assessment-process/20148), and overseeing its implementation.
- Lastly, we believe future versions of Uniswap core protocol are likely to launch with a BSL.

 
### Compensation

We propose that Committee members are compensated with a retainer of $3,500 per 6-month term and a fee of $6,500 for each evaluated project, paid at the end of each 6-month period. We propose a minimum of 2 committee members’ involvement in each agreement proposal.

We also propose an ad-hoc / discretionary budget of $1,000 per committee member to support any legal fees incurred by the team.

Assuming the Committee will review 2 proposals each term, the **maximum estimated budget** for the first iteration of the Accountability committee is $87,500 for the first 6 months, and $170,000 for a year. 

### Motivation

The need for an Accountability role in Uniswap DAO was crystalized in the first **Uniswap Delegate Forum** that Uniswap Foundation and Other Internet hosted in October 2022, following the publication of OI’s [accountability report](https://otherinter.net/research/uniswap-accountability/) for Uniswap, which explored at length the legal, social and on-chain accountability mechanisms available to Uniswap. The Forum led to the creation of a dedicated **Accountability Working Group** to address Uniswap DAO’s accountability challenges.

As observed in the report, at present Uniswap’s strongest accountability measure in the context of licensing and partnership agreements is the Business Source License, which however has limited application toward enforcing the terms of an agreement and the delivery of promised funds after a proposal has been executed. 

Establishing and formalizing an accountability role within Uniswap, with a clear mandate and responsibilities, will greatly **improve accountability toward the DAO, avoid repeating past episodes of missing or delayed funds, and overall facilitate the operational autonomy of the DAO** going forward. We also plan to leverage work on the cross-chain bridge assessment group and liaise with them in security assessments.

### Selection Process

We initially proposed 5 committee members that were participants in the accountability working group that Other Internet ran at the beginning of the year. Following the feedback from the community, we supported Uniswap DAO contributors and delegates nominating themselves for a position on the committee. The committee size is capped at 5 members, at least for the duration of the trial period. The goal of the cap is to keep the costs in check, scale manageable, and committee members accountable.

Desired criteria for committee membership include:

- Context on the history of accountability challenges faced by Uniswap and DAOs in general.
- Demonstrated commitment and active participation in Uniswap governance decisions.
- Understanding and context on prior Uniswap deployment processes.
- Experience managing and negotiating partnerships and agreements.
- Clear understanding of technical architecture of Uniswap v3 and governance.

Create v3deployments.uniswap.eth subdomain and populate its text fields
## Rationale
Per the discussion in the governance forums [here](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-post-bsl-cross-chain-deployment-process-new-uniswap-eth-subdomain/20878) and [here](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-post-bsl-cross-chain-deployment-process-creation-of-new-uniswap-eth-subdomain/20961), and the Snapshot poll [here](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0x0f8a85d90759acf3a6fdc018e20b991f3562847122a8142c4e166c71d0e755e3), canonical deployments of Uniswap v3 will be recorded in a new subdomain. This proposal seeks to create that subdomain (`v3deployments.uniswap.eth`) and populate its text records with all deployments that were granted business source license exemptions and those that have passed governance votes since the license's expiry.

One thing to note - both [zkSync](https://app.uniswap.org/#/vote/2/25) and [Polygon zkEVM](https://app.uniswap.org/#/vote/2/34) have passed governance votes and will be added to the subdomain at a date in the future when their deployments are complete. 

## Process
If executed, this governance proposal will make 9 function calls. At a high level, the first transaction creates the new subdomain and the next 8 add text records to it. The text records are formatted such that the key is the [network number](https://chainlist.org) of the chain in question and the value is a string with the address of the bridge sender contract on mainnet associated with the deployment followed by the UniswapV3Factory address on the destination chain, separated by a space and a comma. Note that this is a slight departure from what was suggested in the forums; after discussing with various members of the governance community it became apparent that including the factory address would be a valuable addition.

We describe the function calls in more detail below, and a detailed simulation of the transaction's execution will be available shortly after this proposal goes live by downloading the Uniswap artifact at the bottom of this [page](https://github.com/Uniswap/governance-seatbelt/actions).

1. Creates the new subdomain by calling the `setSubnodeRecord` on the ENS Registry and passing it the name hash for `uniswap.eth`, the label hash for `v3deployments`, the timelock's address, and the ENS public resolver's address.

5. Creates a new text record on `v3deployments.uniswap.eth` by calling `setText` on the subdomain and passing it the name hash for the subdomain, the key `42220` for Celo and value `0xf7e46b233abd1edaad8dbbbda12129b97b071025, 0xAfE208a311B21f13EF87E33A90049fC17A7acDEc`

6. Creates a new text record on `v3deployments.uniswap.eth` by calling `setText` on the subdomain and passing it the name hash for the subdomain, the key `56`  for Binance Smart Chain and value `0xf5F4496219F31CDCBa6130B5402873624585615a, 0xdB1d10011AD0Ff90774D0C6Bb92e5C5c8b4461F7`

7. Creates a new text record on `v3deployments.uniswap.eth` by calling `setText` on the subdomain and passing it the name hash for the subdomain, the key `100` for Gnosis and value `0xf5f4496219f31cdcba6130b5402873624585615a, 0xe32F7dD7e3f098D518ff19A22d5f028e076489B1`

8. Creates a new text record on `v3deployments.uniswap.eth` by calling `setText` on the subdomain and passing it the name hash for the subdomain, the key `43114` Avalanche and value `0xeb0BCF27D1Fb4b25e708fBB815c421Aeb51eA9fc, 0x740b1c1de25031C31FF4fC9A62f554A55cdC1baD`

9.  Creates a new text record on `v3deployments.uniswap.eth` by calling `setText` on the subdomain and passing it the name hash for the subdomain, the key `288` for Boba and value `0x6D4528d192dB72E282265D6092F4B872f9Dff69e, 0xFFCd7Aed9C627E82A765c3247d562239507f6f1B`

## Summary

We [Michigan Blockchain](https://twitter.com/UMichBlockchain) are submitting this proposal to reinstate the deployment of Uniswap v3 on Polkadot’s EVM-compatible parachain, Moonbeam. The temperature check for this proposal passed with **26M (~100%) YES** votes and **169 (~0%) NO** votes–the proposal stakeholders were agreed upon via the RFC.

## Proposal Motivation

Last spring, the Uniswap DAO voted on this exact topic. The proposal advanced through Uni’s governance rails, receiving positive [feedback from the community](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/governance-proposal-deploy-uniswap-v3-on-moonbeam/16759), progressing past the [temperate check](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/QmaG6nJYW3xLeQwAa6xxhpbuYS8h6PVQpbx1vfqpqxAtik), and eventually passing with a near unanimous YES decision during the [onchain vote](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/uniswap/proposal/19). Nomad was the designated contract deployer and the appointed cross-chain messaging solution for that proposal. Illusory Systems (Nomad) received the Additional Use Grant, which can be seen on the [v3-core-license-grants.uniswap.eth ENS subdomain](https://app.ens.domains/name/v3-core-license-grants.uniswap.eth/details). Although Nomad obtained the license exemption in May 2022, they never began v3 contract deployment on Moonbeam. This can generally be seen as fortuitous from Uniswap’s vantage point as the hiatus allowed Uniswap to avoid exposure to the [Nomad bridge exploit](https://twitter.com/samczsun/status/1554252024723546112?s=20) on August 1, 2022.

Recently, both the [Uniswap](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/governance-proposal-deploy-uniswap-v3-on-moonbeam/16759/12?u=abdullahumar) and [Moonbeam](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/continue-the-uniswap-v3-deployment-on-moonbeam-with-different-bridge-provider/20831) communities have voiced interest in reinstating the previous proposal. As a result, we have conversed with key members of the Moonbeam ecosystem to formulate a reformed proposal with modifications to the previous proposal. This new proposal will contain updates regarding the architecture and activity on both Polkadot and Moonbeam. The previous $2.5M commitment by the Moonbeam foundation to the Uniswap Grants Program (UGP) has been omitted due to difficult market conditions, but there are liquidity incentives available through [Moonbeam Foundation’s Level 3](https://forum.moonbeam.foundation/t/referendum-87-revised-grant-program/399) grant process. This has the potential to qualify for the mentioned grant over the course of the next few months, allowing for more seamless liquidity bootstrapping on Moonbeam.

## Moonbeam, Polkadot, and How Uniswap Benefits

One of the key selling points for Uniswap’s deployment onto Moonbeam is the potential for the DEX to attain market share in the broader Polkadot ecosystem.

### The Polkadot Relay Chain

At the heart of Polkadot lies the Relay Chain, a layer-0 blockchain with limited bells and whistles, lacking native support for smart contracts. The purpose of the Relay Chain is to serve as a simplistic centerpiece into which other blockchains integrate. Layer-1 blockchains that connect to the Relay Chain are called parachains. Each parachain has autonomy over its architecture with a native token, collator set (collators are just validators for a parachain), and governance system. The Polkadot Relay Chain uses Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS) consensus, making it responsible for the crucial task of handling the ecosystem’s security. The chain’s [staking ratio currently sits at 47%](https://www.stakingrewards.com/earn/polkadot/metrics/) (~$4B DOT out of $7.6B DOT mcap) which indicates that nearly half of the token supply is involved in securing Polkadot. Parachain collators aren’t directly responsible for security but are vital for aggregating parachain txns into a block candidate, along with a respective state transition proof, for the Relay Chain to validate. Offloading consensus responsibilities to the Relay Chain liberates parachains and lets them divert their resources and efforts to designing and maintaining specialized L1s like Moonbeam.

### Moonbeam: Polkadot’s Go-to EVM-Compatible Parachain

Moonbeam was inaugurated as Polkadot’s second parachain after it [won a parachain slot auction](https://moonbeam.foundation/moonbeam-crowdloan/) in Q4 2021. Parachain slots are the limited number of seats present on the Relay Chain. Each slot is occupied by a particular project for a lease period of two years. Currently, [43](https://polkadot.subscan.io/parachain) out of the [100 maximum slots](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-parachains-faq#is-100-a-hard-limit-on-the-number-of-parachains-that-can-be-supported) are filled. In order for a parachain slot to become occupied, a project must win a slot auction: a 7-day bidding process during which multiple projects compete to attain a seat on the Relay Chain. The project that bids the most DOT tokens bonds (locks up) the bidded tokens for the duration of slot lease. Bonded tokens are returned post lease expiration. To ease the financial burden of self-funding large bids, projects vie for DOT holders’ contributions to crowdfund their bid. Moonbeam received a total of [35,759,931 DOT from ~200k contributors](https://moonbeam.foundation/moonbeam-crowdloan/), the highest number of tokens committed for any parachain auction. As a reward, DOT contributors received Glimmer ($GLMR), the native Moonbeam token responsible for rewarding collators, network txn fees, and governance. The sheer number of contributors made GLMR’s distribution decentralized.

### XCM & Interoperability

Along with security, the second core function of the Relay Chain is providing trustless interoperability between parachains. The sharing of state and validation logic enables a trustless ecosystem. Individual parachains do not have a reliance on trusting other parachains and can instead depend on the Relay Chain. The specific railway for sending assets and messages to parachains via the Relay Chain is called XCMP, which utilizes a standardized communication format called XCM. This is Polkadot’s way of enabling a versatile cross-chain environment, as XCM is not only limited to parachains but can also be utilized by non-Substrate chains. XCM went live May 2022, the same month that the previous Moonbeam RFC was released. It has since [relayed ~235k messages](https://polkadot.subscan.io/xcm_dashboard). Parity Technologies is constantly iterating on XCM’s functionalities, with [XCM v3 launching soon](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-xcm).

Moonbeam currently [leads all other parachains](https://polkadot.subscan.io/xcm_channel) in terms of cross-parachain txns via XCM channels. Over 2/3 of the top XCM channels involve transfers either to or from Moonbeam, illustrating the parachain’s high usage in the Polkadot ecosystem.

Moonbeam also leveraged XCM to create the XC-20 token standard. XC-20 tokens are essentially Substrate assets that conform to the ERC-20 interface. This is a game changer for Uniswap. Since Uni uses ERC-20 tokens, the DEX struggles to accommodate non-ERC-20 tokens like Substrate native tokens. If a user wants to create a DOT/ETH pool, for instance, this is not possible due to DOT’s incompatibility with Uniswap’s ERC-20 requirement. Utilizing xcDOT, the XC-20 version of DOT, fixes this issue.

This interoperability between parachains will expose Uniswap to the entire Polkadot ecosystem. Uniswap’s presence on Moonbeam will likely become a beacon for users and developers to access liquidity more seamlessly. The transfer of assets and data from Ethereum to Moonbeam to other parachains–and vice versa–would facilitate the overall growth of Polkadot and Uniswap.

### Developers and Ecosystem

As of Q4 2022, Polkadot saw its [full-time developer count](https://www.developerreport.com/) increase to 752, trailing only behind Ethereum. This is in part due to the ease of using the Substrate framework. The rate of growth was on par with Ethereum but lagged behind competing chains like Cosmos and Solana. A more holistic measure of growth would also include the activity present on Polkadot’s canary chain, Kusama, which saw a 21% increase in full-time developers. Prior to launching on Polkadot, projects tend to launch a version of their chain on Kusama–which is not a testnet but a fully sovereign chain–to battle test their product. Kusama hosts a very similar Relay Chain-Parachain architecture to mimic the conditions of Polkadot. Moonbeam’s sister chain on Kusama is called Moonriver. Moonbeam itself saw a full-time developer growth rate of 39%.

Moonbeam is only second to Acala in terms of parachain TVL, with $46.5M spread across 44 different protocols. Due to the ease with which Ethereum developers can launch their EVM dapps onto the parachain, Moonbeam boasts the largest quantity of applications in the Polkadot ecosystem.

The DEX market on Moonbeam is largely uncontested, with StellaSwap absorbing most of the parachain’s TVL. With capital efficient liquidity pools and strong brand recognition, Uniswap’s expansion into the Moonbeam ecosystem will very likely enable it to capture market share from StellaSwap and also attract new users–the goal is not for this to be a zero-sum game.

## Deployment Details

The approval of this proposal by Uniswap governance will lead the stated Uniswap v3 contracts to be deemed as the canonical deployment on Moonbeam. As is the case with all canonical v3 deployments, this deployment will be subject to Ethereum Layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control. The text record of the uniswap.eth ENS subdomain titled v3deployments.uniswap.eth will be amended to include the reference to the stated v3 contracts on Moonbeam.

## Bootstrapping Liquidity

Due to tumultuous market conditions, promises of liquidity bootstrapping have been temporarily excised. However, there are still alternative methods to help procure initial Uni v3 liquidity on Moonbeam post deployment. Michigan Blockchain is currently exploring writing a proposal on the Moonbeam forums via the [Moonbeam Foundation’s Level 3](https://forum.moonbeam.foundation/t/referendum-87-revised-grant-program/399) grant process. We are open to community feedback here, but the plan is for our team to apply for a Moonbeam grant on behalf of the DAO.

## Timeline

This proposal has passed the RFC and temperature check phases. The relevant Uniswap v3 contracts have also been deployed on the Moonbeam chain. If this onchain vote passes, this deployment will be officially recognized as a canonical v3 deployment through an amendment to the v3deployments.uniswap.eth subdomain. Thereafter, Uniswap Labs is left with the task of handling the front-end integration updates and including Moonbeam to the auto router–this final step is not subject to the DAO’s discretion and is handled entirely by Uniswap Labs, a separate entity from DAO."

Proposal Motivation
-------------------

We at [she256](https://twitter.com/she_256) are submitting this proposal to create community agreement on a canonical deployment of Uniswap v3 on Base. The [temperature check](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0xb643c2ccb468812901c9490dbb31c5aada0140e83d0f6ce30e04fc7a237748e8) for this proposal passed with **49M UNI (100%) YES** votes and **95 UNI (0%) NO** votes. The proposal stakeholders were agreed upon in the RFC.

Base is an open-source, developer-friendly L2 EVM blockchain, built on the MIT-licensed OP Stack. Base is being incubated inside of Coinbase and will serve as both a home for Coinbase's onchain products and an open ecosystem for permissionless development. Coinbase has partnered with Optimism throughout the inception and launching of Base to help realize the[  Optimism superchain vision](https://app.optimism.io/superchain). Base mainnet is currently [open for developer access](https://base.mirror.xyz/hwNwqXHVoLlO8s4DZppog4DfGvM34tigaDjOWuEJQfY), with docs available at[  docs.base.org](https://docs.base.org/), and will be available for general access in early August.

Base is aiming to have day-one support for Uniswap v3. We believe there is strong potential for Base to generate high TVL and mobilize an influx of new users to Uniswap because of (1) Base's plan to natively integrate with Coinbase products, which have tens of millions of users, (2) the 50+ dapps/protocols that have committed to deploying on Base, and (3) good signal around initial usage of the Base testnet.

Base, Optimism, and How Uniswap Benefits
----------------------------------------

### Optimism and The Superchain Thesis

Optimism is the [second largest Ethereum L2 by virtue of TVL and volume](https://l2beat.com/scaling/tvl), created with the purpose of helping Ethereum scale. Built using the OP Stack, Optimism relies on a fraud-proof scheme to reliably submit batched transactions to Ethereum L1. For the past ~two years, Ethereum's modular structure has [gained tremendous traction](https://l2beat.com/scaling/tvl) from users due to more favorable txn speed and lower network costs. However, L2s are in and of themselves silos. The limitations of cross-chain interactions between different monolithic chains are apparent--but such issues, albeit to a lesser degree, are still present on rollups. For instance, the execution layers for the most popular L2s remain separate, with the shared aspect being a common layer for consensus, settlement, and data availability, the Ethereum L1. This is where the [Superchain](https://www.optimism.io/superchain) thesis comes into play, aiming to create a standardized architecture for L2 development.

The OP Stack is currently undergoing a significant scalability improvement by introducing the concept of a Superchain. This new system will create a network of chains that share various features such as bridging, upgrades, decentralized governance, and a communication layer, all of which will be built on the existing OP Stack. The goal of this new system is to merge the current Optimism Mainnet and other chains--built using the OP Stack--into a single unified network of OP Chains, thereby taking a significant step towards bringing scalable and decentralized compute to the world. The Superchain currently stands as an ideal in the development phase, not a materialized product. Developing a robust system of OP Chains is likely to take a couple of years.

As the Superchain vision takes hold, it will strive to integrate siloed L2s into an interoperable and composable system, allowing for seamless communication between individual chains built using the OP Stack as well as a simplistic process for developing L2s, with the backend complexities being abstracted from developers' purview. Commoditizing the nature of L2s frees builders to concentrate on perfecting the specific value proposition of their chain as opposed to meddling with the overhead that arises with constructing blockchains from scratch. The OP Stack enables for a more plug-and-play system where builders can incorporate specific ""modules"" for customizing their chains. Individual OP Chains will have the ability to select their customized data availability module, while simultaneously remaining connected to the other swath of OP Chains which may have opted in for an alternative data availability module. Hence, the Superchain is a healthy blend between a shared, standardized development architecture and a robust set of individualizing modules for the specific aspirations of individual OP Chains.

### Coinbase and The Rise of Base

[Coinbase has joined](https://optimism.mirror.xyz/2jk3D1Y8-hid8YOCUUa6yXmsyzNCYYyFJP0Nhaey9x0) as both a core developer of the OP Stack and a new L2 chain built on the OP codebase through its deployment of Base. As a core developer, Coinbase will collaborate with OP Labs in contributing to the Optimism Collective's mission of extending the OP Stack as a public good. Moreover, as a chain, Base will commit a portion of its transaction fee revenue to the Optimism Collective treasury.

The collaboration's immediate goal is to upgrade Optimism Mainnet, Base, and other L2s to an initial Superchain structure with shared bridging and sequencing. In the long term, the shared vision is for the Superchain to become a vast network that maximizes interoperability, shares decentralized protocols, standardizes core primitives, and funds the public goods that make it all possible. 

Base is an Ethereum L2 network striving to offer a secure, low-cost, developer-friendly environment for building onchain dapps, using the open-source OP Optimism stack. In pursuit of this goal, Base will serve as both a home for Coinbase's onchain products as well as an open platform for any developers to permissionlessly contribute towards. Development on Base in general will require a source for liquidity provision, and as is the case with the other L2s, Uniswap composes the largest portion of that market. 

[Four key principles](https://base.mirror.xyz/jjQnUq_UNTQOk7psnGBFOsShi7FlrRp8xevQUipG_Gk) have shaped Base that will also continue to guide its approach:

1.  **Bridges > Islands.** Base is being designed to facilitate easy and secure access to Ethereum L1, other L2s, and other L1 ecosystems such as Bitcoin, Solana, and Cosmos. As a bridge for users into the cryptoeconomy, it will provide an easy-to-use, default onchain experience with access to products on other chains. Coinbase intends to initiate Base to be interoperable with other chains while continuing to support as many chains as possible across the Coinbase product suite.

2.  **Open-source.** As Base is built on the MIT-licensed OP Stack, it is freely available and fully open source. Coinbase is joining as the second core dev team working on the OP Stack, ensuring it is a public good available to everyone. This toolkit is an open platform that anyone can contribute to, fork, and extend to help the cryptoeconomy scale.

3.  **Decentralization.** Decentralization is essential for the cryptoeconomy to remain open, global, and accessible to everyone. With the increased resources that Coinbase brings to the OP Stack, Base is expected to progress from a [Stage 0 to Stage 1](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1609209529706872833?s=20) rollup in 2023--and to a [Stage 2 rollup](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/proposed-milestones-for-rollups-taking-off-training-wheels/11571) in 2024.

4.  **Robust.** Base aims to be an open ecosystem initially bootstrapped with Coinbase products, users, and assets. Coinbase is working with the broader community to bring the chain to life, and counts a significant group of Day 0 builders and projects that will contribute to making Base a robust ecosystem.

As highlighted in the [Mulitchain Uniswap](https://blog.uniswap.org/multichain-uniswap) blog post, we share the belief that users ""should access Web3 on chains with properties that are important to them."" Since Base's core goal is to provide a secure, low-cost, developer-friendly L2 environment for building onchain dapps we feel it fitting for Uniswap to be live from day-one. The potential for Uniswap to capture the inflow of new users from the off-chain world is a promising opportunity for the DEX to reach a new audience. As of December 2023, Coinbase had nearly [$80B of assets under custody, 80% higher](https://messari.io/report/pump-up-the-base) than the onchain TVL at the time. Across v2 and v3, Uniswap only has [$4B in TVL](https://defillama.com/protocol/uniswap). 

### Developers and Ecosystem

There has been strong initial engagement with developers on Base, as seen below with the preliminary list of partners and metrics. In addition, an unofficial Base ecosystem account has mapped out the Base ecosystem in [this twitter thread](https://twitter.com/UniverseOnBase/status/1655594580870578176).

In its first week, Base saw [18K developers deploy 55K smart contracts](https://base.mirror.xyz/rA5v_0BTc5AwmZdnui7ku82FzF1aTE6TJ_3vds9ymBc) on testnet. Since the Base testnet launch on 2.23.23, metrics show [2M accounts created and 17.5M transactions](https://base-goerli.blockscout.com/stats), and over 1 million addresses holding a[  Base Builder NFT](https://goerli.basescan.org/token/0xAC6564F3718837CaAdd42Eed742d75c12b90a052) for participating in[  Base Quests](https://quests.base.org/).

In addition, Base has seen impressive retention, with the highest number of unique wallet users ([~70,000](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/hess/base-retention-BUjJWB)) returning to the Base chain for subsequent transactions within one day, representing [43% of the total users](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/hess/base-retention-BUjJWB). The users, in this case, are likely mostly developers, given that these metrics are from a testnet, which gives a promising outlook for the activity that will be seen on Base mainnet. 

Success Criteria
----------------

A successful deployment of Uniswap on Base would result in Uniswap becoming the de facto DEX for Base upon launching. Some specific indicators of success include the following:

-   **Increased TVL:** Base aims to integrate seamlessly into the Coinbase ecosystem (products + users), which creates an opportunity to introduce many net new users to Uniswap, in addition to existing users who utilize Uniswap on other chains.

-   **Security and Scalability:** Base leverages the underlying security of Ethereum to enable confident on-ramps onto Base from Coinbase, Ethereum L1, and other interoperable chains.

-   **Developer Empowerment and Integration:** Base has focused on [its builder community](https://base.mirror.xyz/rA5v_0BTc5AwmZdnui7ku82FzF1aTE6TJ_3vds9ymBc), which will ideally include Uniswap.  Developers are also better enabled to join the Coinbase ecosystem, with seamless Coinbase product integrations, easy fiat onramps, and powerful acquisition tools. Because of these offerings, we believe Base will attract a wide range of dapp developers. Many of these dapps may utilize Uniswap or bring more users into the ecosystem, who may then use Uniswap. For this reason, we believe that adding a new chain that is focused on developers will grow the pie and be a net positive for the ecosystem and Uniswap.

-   **Efficiency and Cost:** Base offers full EVM compatibility at a fraction of the cost of Ethereum mainnet and is committed to pushing forward the developer platform with features including gasless transactions for dapps, simple developer APIs for account abstraction, and secure build environments for multichain applications. This should help create a Uniswap user experience and developer opportunity that is not possible on Ethereum L1.

-   **Values Alignment:** Base is open source, built on the MIT-licensed OP Stack. It aims to contribute toward the vision of creating a standard, modular, rollup agnostic Superchain[  powered by Optimism](https://base.mirror.xyz/H_KPwV31M7OJT-THUnU7wYjOF16Sy7aWvaEr5cgHi8I). Thus driving greater accessibility, efficiency, and transparency in the ecosystem in alignment with Uniswap Foundation core initiatives.

Conflict of Interest Declaration
--------------------------------

-   Anika (member of she256) works on the Base engineering team at Coinbase. She will abstain from voting on this proposal in her role at she256.

-   Kendra (member of she256) is on the Uniswap Accountability Committee for Deployments. She will recuse herself from any Committee actions relating to this proposal.

Deployment Details
------------------

The approval of this proposal by Uniswap governance will lead the stated Uniswap v3 contracts to be deemed as the canonical deployment on Base. As is the case with all canonical v3 deployments, this deployment will be subject to Ethereum Layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control. The text record of the uniswap.eth ENS subdomain titled v3deployments.uniswap.eth will be amended to include the reference to the stated v3 contracts on Base.

## Point of Contact:
Consensys
GFX Labs

## Proposal Overview
Consensys is seeking a Uniswap V3 deployment for Linea’s mainnet launch, looking to further integrate Uniswap with the Consensys product ecosystem (MetaMask, Infura, Linea, et. al). A key aspect of Linea’s value proposition is its synergistic relationship with ConsenSys products. Establishing Uniswap as a dominant DEX on Linea would encourage more trading volume for the protocol and strengthen ties to current Consensys product users.

### Motivation
Linea’s testnet has impressively handled more than 47 million transactions. Many of these transactions are part of the Linea Voyage quest, a crucial initiative designed to help stress-test the network. This exercise aids in identifying potential issues and performance impediments before transitioning to Linea mainnet.

Moreover, Linea is aligned with developers throughout the broader ecosystem via our relationships with MetaMask, Infura, and Truffle, emphasizing our commitment in serving developers, protocols, and builders.


Users will conveniently find Linea natively supported in the MetaMask network dropdown list, and it will support the full range of MetaMask curated experiences. These experiences include On/Off Ramp, MetaBridge, MetaMask Swaps, Portfolio dApp, and MetaMask SDK - all of which could leverage the Uniswap protocol.

## About Linea
Linea aims to be a Type 2 zkEVM 1 and achieve EVM-equivalence, handling native EVM bytecode for proving and verification. This allows for the execution of Solidity smart contracts and enables developers to build while using familiar tools and infrastructure at extremely low switching costs. The network does not use transpilers or custom compilers on bytecode. By taking the compiled bytecode directly from solidity, we significantly reduce the surface area risk for bugs and hacks.

Linea seeks innovation, pushing the boundaries of the Web3 space while maintaining top security and full EVM compatibility as top priorities. One (of the many) things worth mentioning is Linea’s full support of EIP-4337 (Account Abstraction). Working with key stakeholders, the network already uses the single-entry-point contract and runs multiple networks of bundlers and paymasters services.

### Vortex - Lattice-Based SNARKs
What is particularly exciting about Linea is its ability to consolidate transactions and submit proofs to the Ethereum mainnet using a novel prover mechanism. This process enhances throughput and minimizes transaction fees while maintaining the inherent security of the Ethereum network.

Vortex , a cryptographic primitive under development at ConsenSys, aims to increase the performance of Linea. It leverages a novel type of zkProof called a recursive aggregation proof. This is based on Ring-SIS, a well-known premise from lattice-based cryptography. This proofing system enables the batching of transactions to increase the network’s throughput while reducing fees. Linea also employs zk circuits to conduct computations. These cryptographic circuits facilitate secure and efficient computations.


## Market Adoption
Since the inception of Ethereum, ConsenSys was established to become the most potent proponent of decentralization worldwide. We believe that networks such as Ethereum can empower humanity to reach greater heights. With our experience handling web3 infrastructure, wallets, developer tools, public goods, and more, we are confident in our ability to steward Linea to complete decentralization and openness.

Linea is the result of more than 20 months of R&D from our award-winning research team that has released and maintains successful projects in the zk space like the GNARK library. Linea represents advancements in the zkEVM realm and the general field of cryptography. With the Linea network being incubated via Consensys, adoption will be encouraged through existing Consensys products and partnerships.



Some of these integrations include but are not limited to:

- MetaMask - Largest Web3 wallet, easy user onboarding with default integration.
- Infura - Simplified deployment lets developers ship faster and scale with the confidence of 99.9% uptime.
- Truffle - Build, test, debug, and deploy Solidity smart contracts with tools like Truffle, Hardhat, and more.
- Besu - Optimized execution for zkEVM transactions using Ethereum battle-tested components.
- Lastly, nearly all EVM-specific development tools are Linea compatible.

### Decentralization Roadmap
Linea is committed to actively pursuing decentralization. Over the following year, the Linea team plans to implement decentralizing features. Examples include introducing a DAO, decentralized sequencers and prover systems.

## Benefits for Uniswap
There are many benefits to a Uniswap deployment on Linea. In the following sections, we highlight our top three…

- Early Establishment in the Linea AMM Market
- Increased Volume through MetaMask Swaps Integration
- Cross Promotion


### Early Establishment in the Linea AMM Market
Observing Uniswap market share across crucial Layer 2 solutions reveals that the protocol enjoys several advantages x-chain. These include a strong community, brand recognition, and, most importantly, the first-mover advantage.

Total value locked (TVL) of Uniswap across significant roll-up ecosystems:

- Arbitrum - 316.12M
- Optimism - 82.5M

We anticipate that Uniswap will replicate its success in capturing market share on Linea, and we also hope that this deployment will serve as a model for the DAO on how Uniswap will perform with all upcoming L2/zkEVM launches over the next 6-8 months.

### Increased Volume through Swaps Integration
MetaMask Swaps is an aggregation product built natively into MetaMask. Across all integrated chains, as of last week, Swaps had an average weekly volume of ~$133M. Uniswap is consistently the largest leveraged dex of this weekly volume, executing ~58%, or $77.1M of trades.

Most of this volume is directed through Ethereum; however, observing comparable L2 deployments shows that Swaps contributed nearly 100M of volume to Arbitrum since integration.

Products like Swaps leverage many service providers, and only a few of them will be deployed on Linea day 1, providing Uniswap the opportunity to capture an even bigger market share of L2 volume produced from the product.

### Cross Promotion
Another benefit for the protocol is the cross-promotion between Consensys and Uniswap, and to double down on the shared mission of contributing to the growth of the Ethereum ecosystem. The team plans to promote the network’s usage and the protocols that operate on it. This, combined with utilizing a recognized deployment of Uniswap, will aid in establishing Uniswap on Linea and in the greater ecosystem.

## Additional Information
### Costs and Incentives
Consensys will cover all deployment costs, and is willing to contribute any engineering resources required for the deployment.

### Cross Chain Messaging
The Linea team operates and maintains a canonical Open Messaging Service (OMS). The OMS allows for messages to pass to and from Ethereum & Linea. The Ethereum network verifies smart contracts on the L1 that enforce a valid state on Linea.

### Security Considerations
The OMS will be operated in-house. The design implements a relayer and leverages the rollup to maintain state/security.


### Success Criteria
Although it is difficult to quantify success criteria, we can confidently state that establishing Uniswap as an early, dominant DEX is a priority.

The overarching success of the Uniswap deployment will be determined through increasing key DeFi metrics that include TVL, Volume, Users, and Swaps. Upon deployment, we will provide a dashboard to monitor Uniswap’s progress and assess market performance.

### Proposer Details
ConsenSys is a leading Ethereum and decentralized protocols software company. We enable developers, enterprises, and people worldwide to build next-generation web3 applications, launch modern financial infrastructure, and access the decentralized web. Our product suite, composed of MetaMask, Infura, Truffle, Diligence, and CNFT, serves millions of users. ConsenSys has the technical expertise to deploy Uniswap.

GFX Labs is a research and development company focused on decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain technology. The Chicago-based company recently launched Oku, an advanced trading interface for Uniswap v3. GFX Labs' goal is to support the democratization of finance through innovations in decentralized finance and finance technology.

### Conflict of Interest
ConsenSys is an active delegate and provides software services to Uniswap Labs. However, these developments and contractual relationships do not impact the organization’s independence.

[Link to snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0x2a122241d608b92e605e3e2ece355e97c5691ac0448da5653025e2c929628625)

# Background
The Celo deployment of the Uniswap Protocol is currently connected to the mainnet governance contracts via Optics. The Optics bridge is not currently approved by the Uniswap Bridge Assessment Committee and is not on a path to be approved. To that end, we put forward this proposal to change the cross-chain messaging protocol used to interact with the Celo deployment of Uniswap from Optics to Wormhole.

# Process
Deploy a new Wormhole bridge receiver contract on Celo. This contract 9 was deployed on July 5th, 2023 and its configuration was verified by the Wormhole team and the Uniswap Foundation. Change the owner of the UniswapV3Factory contract on Celo from the existing Optics bridge receiver to the new Wormhole bridge receiver A governance vote will be required to make this change. Per the normal governance process, this RFC will remain open for a week and the Celo and Wormhole teams will answer any questions that arise. After a week, a Snapshot poll will be posted. Pending a successful Snapshot, an on-chain vote will be instantiated.

Upon completion of this procedure, subsequent governance messages destined for Celo will be transmitted via the UniswapWormholeMessageSender [0xf5F4496219F31CDCBa6130B5402873624585615a](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf5F4496219F31CDCBa6130B5402873624585615a) and received on Celo by the wormholeReceiverContract [0x0Eb863541278308c3A64F8E908BC646e27BFD071](https://celoscan.io/address/0x0Eb863541278308c3A64F8E908BC646e27BFD071).

# Conclusion
In alignment with the standards endorsed by the Uniswap DAO’s cross-chain bridge assessment team, this proposal recommends migrating the Celo UniswapV3Factory contract owner from the Optics bridge to the Wormhole bridge. This shift will make use of the existing Optics governance bridge to implement the transition and ensure that the cross-chain governance mechanism aligns with the assessment team’s recognized structure.

# Update: Celo as a Layer Two
We recognize Celo’s move to an L2 on Ethereum. However, given Optics’ impending phase-out before Celo completes this transition, it’s important we proceed with the proposed switch to the Wormhole bridge rather than postponing until after the transition and then proposing a bridge migration. After Celo’s transition to an L2, we may reassess and propose a further migration to the canonical bridge.

## Summary
This is a joint proposal combining [Gauntlet](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-gauntlet-dynamic-incentive-optimization-for-uniswap-v3-on-arbitrum/21426) and [Gamma Strategies’](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-gamma-strategies-distribute-at-least-1-3-of-arb-airdrop-as-liquidity-incentives/21345) responses to an [RFP](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/request-for-proposals-arb-distribution/21287) published in May 2023. It was written with input from the Angle, Arrakis, Open Block Labs, and 0xPlasma teams; the DefiEdge and BrincX teams have reviewed and approved and will join as liquidity managers. All active liquidity management protocols are welcome to review and participate.

Broadly speaking, Gauntlet will perform the analysis to determine which pools receive how much $ARB rewards and for what duration. Angle Protocol will use its Merkl root solution to distribute those incentives to all liquidity providers, including those who provide to an LP NFT or to active liquidity managers.

## Proposal Details
This proposal passes three messages through the [Arbitrum Delayed Inbox](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4dbd4fc535ac27206064b68ffcf827b0a60bab3f), each of which calls the transfer function on the ARB token.
- 15,000 ARB will be sent to OpenBlock Labs for work described below   
- 150,000 ARB will be sent to Gauntlet for work described below   
- 1,835,000 ARB will be sent to a 3/4 multisig for distribution of rewards via Angle's Merkl contracts, as described below. 
  

Signers on that multisig include:  

- [Erin Koen](https://twitter.com/eek637), [Uniswap Foundation](https://twitter.com/UniswapFND) 
- [BP](https://twitter.com/BP_Gamma), [Gamma Strategies](https://twitter.com/GammaStrategies) 
- [Matt Dobel](https://twitter.com/mattdobel), [Gauntlet](https://twitter.com/gauntlet_xyz) 
- [Pablo Veyrat](https://twitter.com/pablo_veyrat), [Angle Protocol](https://twitter.com/AngleProtocol)

A description of the Delayed Inbox can be found [here](https://docs.arbitrum.io/arbos/l1-to-l2-messaging). A more human-readable description of the functions called in this proposal can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/erin-koen/7c87d5ed66a627f67b08ec824846fea9). Simulated results of this proposal passing will be available [here](https://github.com/Uniswap/governance-seatbelt/actions) by navigating to the latest successful Governance Check workflow and downloading the Uniswap artifact at the bottom of the page.

## Methodology
Gauntlet has built an optimization engine which takes in both on and off-chain data to generate recommendations for incentive distributions which aims to generate long-term benefits to the incentivizing protocol. In the case of Uniswap, it will aim to choose parameters which will maximize expected future protocol benefit per $ of incentive spent. Market data used for their models include historical price trajectories, competitor data, and user level cohort data.

Angle Protocol developed Merkl which is based on an off-chain script that computes the rewards for all LPs of these pools according to specific preferences. The script aggregates onchain LP NFTs and active manager LP positions and records eligible rewards based on a uniform criteria. It then compresses this information into a Merkl root and posts on-chain allowing LPs to claim their rewards.

ARB held in the multisig will be used to fund a Merkl contract for distribution to eligible liquidity providers on a cadence determined by Gauntlet's recommendations. For in-depth discussions on Gauntlet's methodology and the Merkle distribution solution please see the proposals linked above.

## Liquidity Manager Analytics
Additionally, OpenBlock Labs will leverage their data intelligence platform to deliver comprehensive analytics for the liquidity management protocols participating in Uniswap’s incentive management program on Arbitrum. These analytics will offer detailed insights into the user base of each liquidity manager, assessing the distribution of their liquidity providers (LPs) and capturing important attributes regarding their behavior. The analysis will further evaluate the stickiness of these LPs, thereby gauging the effectiveness of the rewards system. Armed with this data, liquidity management protocols could tweak their parameters to increase their efficacy.

## Details
- Distribution amount: 2M $ARB 
- Gauntlet Fee: 150k ARB 
- OpenBlock Fee: 15k ARB

## Summary
This [joint proposal](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temp-check-combined-liquidity-incentivization-proposal/21545) combines the [Gauntlet](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-gauntlet-dynamic-incentive-optimization-for-uniswap-v3-on-arbitrum/21426) and [Gamma Strategies’](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-gamma-strategies-distribute-at-least-1-3-of-arb-airdrop-as-liquidity-incentives/21345) responses to an [RFP published in May 2023](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/request-for-proposals-arb-distribution/21287). It was written with input from the Angle, Arrakis, Open Block Labs, and 0xPlasma teams; the DefiEdge and BrincX teams have reviewed and approved and will join as liquidity managers. All active liquidity management protocols are welcome to review and participate.

Broadly speaking, Gauntlet will perform the analysis to determine which pools receive how much $ARB rewards and for what duration. Angle Protocol will use its Merkl root solution to distribute those incentives to all liquidity providers, including those who provide to an LP NFT or to active liquidity managers.

## Proposal Details
This proposal passes three messages through the Arbitrum Delayed Inbox, each of which calls the transfer function on the ARB token.

- 15,000 ARB will be sent to OpenBlock Labs for work described below
- 150,000 ARB will be sent to Gauntlet for work described below
- 1,835,000 ARB will be sent to a 3/4 multisig for distribution of rewards via Angle's Merkl contracts, as described below.

Signers on that multisig include:

- [Erin Koen](https://twitter.com/eek637), [Uniswap Foundation](https://twitter.com/uniswapfnd)
- [BP](https://twitter.com/BP_Gamma), [Gamma Strategies](https://twitter.com/gammastrategies)
- [Matt Dobel](https://twitter.com/mattdobel), [Gauntlet](https://twitter.com/gauntlet_xyz)
- [Pablo Veyrat](https://twitter.com/pablo_veyrat), [Angle Protocol](https://twitter.com/AngleProtocol)

A description of the Delayed Inbox can be found [here](https://docs.arbitrum.io/arbos/l1-to-l2-messaging). A more human-readable description of the functions called in this proposal can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/erin-koen/7c87d5ed66a627f67b08ec824846fea9). Simulated results of this proposal passing will be available [here](https://github.com/Uniswap/governance-seatbelt/actions) by navigating to the latest successful Governance Check workflow and downloading the Uniswap artifact at the bottom of the page.

## Methodology
Gauntlet has built an optimization engine which takes in both on and off-chain data to generate recommendations for incentive distributions which aims to generate long-term benefits to the incentivizing protocol. In the case of Uniswap, it will aim to choose parameters which will maximize expected future protocol benefit per $ of incentive spent. Market data used for their models include historical price trajectories, competitor data, and user level cohort data.

Angle Protocol developed Merkl which is based on an off-chain script that computes the rewards for all LPs of these pools according to specific preferences. The script aggregates onchain LP NFTs and active manager LP positions and records eligible rewards based on a uniform criteria. It then compresses this information into a Merkl root and posts on-chain allowing LPs to claim their rewards.

ARB held in the multisig will be used to fund a Merkl contract for distribution to eligible liquidity providers on a cadence determined by Gauntlet's recommendations. For in-depth discussions on Gauntlet's methodology and the Merkle distribution solution please see the proposals linked above.

## Liquidity Manager Analytics
Additionally, OpenBlock Labs will leverage their data intelligence platform to deliver comprehensive analytics for the liquidity management protocols participating in Uniswap’s incentive management program on Arbitrum. These analytics will offer detailed insights into the user base of each liquidity manager, assessing the distribution of their liquidity providers (LPs) and capturing important attributes regarding their behavior. The analysis will further evaluate the stickiness of these LPs, thereby gauging the effectiveness of the rewards system. Armed with this data, liquidity management protocols could tweak their parameters to increase their efficacy.

## Details
Distribution amount: 2M $ARB   
Gauntlet Fee: 150k ARB  
OpenBlock Fee: 15k ARB  
Angle Merkle Fee: 3% of distributed ARB

Declare canonical deployments of V2
This proposal will add references to canonical implementations of Uniswap V2 to text records on a new subdomain on uniswap.eth.

If passed and executed, this proposal will call two functions:
- the first creates the `v2deployments` subdomain by calling `setSubnodeRecord` on the ENS Registry contract and passing it hashed values of the uniswap.eth name and v2deployments subname, as well as the timelock's address and the address of the resolver linked to uniswap.eth
- the second populates text records by passing the encoded hex data representing 10 separate `setText` calls to a `multicall` function on the resolver. Each `setText` call specifies the network ID of the chain in question as the key and the bridge sender and destination v2Factory contract addresses as the values, separated by a comma (e.g.
`{""10"": addr1, addr2}` )

The code used to derive these values can be found in a Github repo [here](https://github.com/uniswapfoundation/governance-seatbelt/blob/main/sims/v2-subdomain.sim.ts).

A full list of deployment addresses can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I2viBd0SbYs8M83bC3HKvYh_zh8i2_CjMMbMfP9bPSk/edit?usp=sharing).

Simulations of this proposal's successful execution can be found by navigating [here](https://github.com/Uniswap/governance-seatbelt/actions), clicking on the latest successful workflow run and downloading the Uniswap artifact at the bottom of the page.

The forum discussion around this proposal can be found [here](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-deploy-uniswap-v2-on-all-chains-with-v3/21799) and has been copied below as well.

## TL;DR
* The only canonical deployment of Uniswap V2 is on Ethereum mainnet.
* There is demand for V2-style AMMs on non-Ethereum chains and many V2 forks have been deployed with varying degrees of modification.
* To the extent that these forks have been modified, they may prove unsafe for users.
* To the extent that these forks have liquidity, that liquidity could likely have accrued to Uniswap V2.
* The combination of Uniswap V2 and Uniswap V3 can often provide better execution for small-volume swappers via the Universal Router.

## Introduction
When Uniswap V3’s [Business Source License](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/LICENSE) expired and the code’s license transitioned to [GPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html), the DAO [created a process](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-post-bsl-cross-chain-deployment-process-creation-of-new-uniswap-eth-subdomain/20961) by which it would declare canonical deployments of the contracts. This process serves to identify instances of the V3 code that are a) not modified and b) owned and controlled by the Uniswap governance contracts. These assurances are meant to provide developers and users with comfort that the code they’re using is safe and any changes to it (to the extent that changes are even possible) will be telegraphed long in advance.

Uniswap V2 is governed by the same permissive GPL license but has not been subject to the same DAO-run multi-chain expansion as V3. Instead, it has been forked and deployed under different brand names and across many chains almost continuously since Sushi’s vampire attack in the summer of 2020. These forks may contain modifications to the code, and their ownership structure can range from DAO governance contracts to single-signature wallets. Nevertheless, forks of V2 can garner [significant liquidity and volume](https://defillama.com/protocols/dexes/Base) relative to other AMMs.

## Proposal
Deploy Uniswap V2 on all chains where there is there is a canonical instance of V3.

## Rationale
There are at least three compelling arguments to move forward with this proposal.

First, V2 forks have been plagued by hacks that have caused the loss of user funds. The Uniswap V2 contracts have been deployed on mainnet since [May 4, 2020](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xc31d7e7e85cab1d38ce1b8ac17e821ccd47dbde00f9d57f2bd8613bff9428396) with no loss of user funds; they can be considered among the most battle-hardened contracts on Ethereum. Canonical versions of the Uniswap contracts can provide DEX users on new chains - swappers, liquidity providers, and developers - with the safety and security for which the protocol is known.

Second, there is demand for traditional, full-range AMMs on new chains. Uniswap should be in a place to service this demand and continue to grow our user base and brand equity across multiple ecosystems.

Third, integrating Uniswap V2 pools into the Universal Router will help incrementally improve execution quality for applications that already use the Router to allow their users to swap."

Thanks to everyone who has taken the time to read and help iterate our proposal for the UNI-ARB Grant Program (UAGP) and Protocol Delegate Program! Talking with you all has made us even more excited about how the Uniswap DAO can strengthen both the Uniswap / Arbitrum ecosystems.

As outlined in the[ temperature check](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temp-check-create-a-uni-arb-working-group/21583/1), the proposal suggests the creation of the UAGP and Protocol Delegate Program, utilizing a significant allocation of 2.2m $ARB tokens to enhance the Uniswap ecosystem on the Arbitrum Protocol.

After an 8-week research sprint and iterations with delegates in our capacity as Working Group Zero (WG0), we've fine-tuned the structure for both the UAGP and Protocol Delegate Program. 

Now it is time to vote on the funding of both of these programs with parts of the received $ARB airdrop. Following a successful onchain proposal, WG0 will lead a nomination and election process to fill the UAGP and Protocol Delegate Program with more members. As initiators of the programs, we have an ambition to be part of the mentioned programs and would feel privileged to help drive these forward.

## Background

The ARB airdrop provides the Uniswap community with an opportunity to enhance its presence within the Arbitrum ecosystem, thus nurturing growth. 

**The UNI-ARB Working Group Zero aims to unify various governance initiatives into a single, coherent system. This helps us align with Uniswap's vision and positions us to take advantage of future allocation opportunities.**

Therefore, we proposed the establishment of a Working Group 0 that had the task to structure the UNI-ARB Grant Program and Protocol Delegate Program and get to an on-chain vote:

1. **Grant Program: 1.1 million (25% of the total airdrop) ARB tokens for UNI-ARB Grants -** Supporting growth and development of projects exclusively within the Uniswap-Arbitrum ecosystem, with a focus on long-term benefits.
2. **Protocol Delegate Program: 1.1 million (25% of the total airdrop) ARB tokens for Governance -** Empowering the committee to actively participate in Arbitrum governance and influence strategic decisions. 


# 1. UNI/ARB Grant Program (UAGP)

After an extensive 8-week research phase with the WG0–researching leading Grant Programs, expert interviews, and iterations with Uni delegates–we're excited to introduce a best-in-class Grant Program designed to become a pacesetter for future Uniswap grant initiatives.  


## Summary
- This proposal outlines a **framework for funding Uniswap and Arbitrum ecosystem development with grants** from the Arbitrum Airdrop.
- Concentrating on **fewer but more impactful initiatives, the committee will focus on grants from 50 - 250k $ ARB** (vs. a large number of grants to smaller projects) and administer a budget capped at $1 million ARB for the initial 6 months. 
- To manage the manual nature of grants administration, we propose a *committee of 5 members — one operating lead and five reviewers (incl. operating lead) — to efficiently allocate funds without necessitating community votes on each application.
- **Monthly reports will update the community** on decisions taken and each funded project's status.



## Mission

The UNI/ARB Grant Program (UAGP) aims to:

- **Fund High-Impact Projects:** The program allocates grants specifically to projects that demonstrate the potential for substantial positive impact on the Uniswap and Arbitrum ecosystems.
- **Strengthen the Uniswap and Arbitrum Ecosystems:** The UNI/ARB Grant Program (UAGP) aims to strengthen the ties and facilitate exchange between the Uniswap and Arbitrum ecosystems.
- **Ensure Transparency and Community Input:** The program mandates regular progress reports and seeks community feedback to influence the direction of funded projects.


## Grant Program Design & Approach

Setting up a best-in-class Grant Program is a multifaceted task. We broke it down into its key components, aligned with a grantee's journey, to effectively solve the typical challenges of grant programs. 

With our WG0, we took 8 weeks to do research on the leading Grant programs from other protocols (UGP, Aave, Metamask, Synthetix), conduct expert interviews with Grant Program leads from multiple ecosystems, and iteration sessions with 8 larger Uni delegates (voting power of ≥2.5M UNI).

## Exec view

- **$1 million ARB allocated across impactful grants**, with allocation sizes between **$50-250k per project**.
- **5-member committee** responsible for selection and oversight, led by an operating lead.
- A **transparent nomination and election process for additional committee members**, emphasizing a blend of technical and investment expertise.
- Our objective is to **distribute the grant funds within the initial 6-month period**.
- We aim for **close alignment with Uniswap Foundation** to receive continuous feedback on priorities while generally operating independently to avoid overlaps..



## Key Pillars

### (A) **Grant Program Objectives and Criteria**

**Objectives**

For an extensive description of our objectives, please refer to the mission statement above. The program focuses on three key areas:

- **Fund High-Impact Projects**
- **Strengthen the Uniswap and Arbitrum Ecosystems**
- **Ensure Transparency and Community Input**


**RFP-based Program vs. Open**

Rather than solely relying on inbound applications for grant distribution, we decided for an RFP-based approach to align with high-impact themes that we defined and got feedback on by a range of delegates, the Uniswap Foundation, and active community members. 

To gather these ideas, we carefully selected an initial list of RFPs for funding, with a priority on projects offering the highest potential value for Uniswap. These initial themes are designed to remain adaptable, allowing for continuous adjustments to meet the evolving needs of the ecosystem. This process merged what we identified as valuable contributions within Working Group 0 with valuable guidance and feedback from both delegates and UF.

1. **Liquidity Management and Derivative Protocols**:\
   _The development of derivative and liquidity management protocols interacting with Uniswap can pave the way for more sophisticated instruments and strategies on Arbitrum, seeing new increases in transaction volumes and TVL._

2. **Arbitrum testnet with EIP-1153 enabled**:\
   _Currently, developers aiming to test Uniswap v4 face a cumbersome and convoluted procedure. This process, which needs to be executed locally, is far from straightforward. The lack of a streamlined approach poses challenges and inefficiencies for these developers. There's a pressing need for a more intuitive and efficient testing environment or system to simplify this procedure for Uniswap v4._

3. **Uniswap v4 Infrastructure Dev Tools**:\
   _The intricacies of Uniswap v4 are difficult for present-day development tools to manage, often resulting in less-than-smooth implementations. From this perspective, it underscores the necessity for a new or improved toolset that specifically adds value to the Uniswap-Arbitrum ecosystem. To prevent overlap with UF in the context of this particular RFC, which focuses on general Uniswap v4 development, we will closely coordinate our inbound with UF._

4. **Uniswap on Arbitrum Ecosystem tools or products**:\
   _Tools or products for the ecosystem that aim to strengthen the protocol, elevate user engagement, and capture attention from new users and outside parties. This category is kept broad intentionally to allow for a broad range of contributions and targeting and tech tool or product fulfilling the aforementioned target._
   
5. **Open Contribution**: 
   _A variety of initiatives and applications, not necessarily aligning with the previous four categories, are welcomed by the Grant Program. This flexibility allows for the embrace of a wide range of contributions from our community, promoting growth and innovation within the Uniswap-Arbitrum ecosystem._



### (B) Application Process

To efficiently handle the anticipated surge in applications, we've implemented a streamlined process that initially screens applications using RFPs and team requirements. These applications will be submitted through Airtable and published in Notion. Following this, we will manually review all projects to identify those warranting further due diligence in a structured process: 

- **Initial Screening & RFP/Open Submission:** Applicants complete an online form, choosing to either address a specific Request for Proposals (RFP) or opt for an open submission. This step serves as our first layer of manual screening.
- **In-Depth Review & Feedback:** Projects that pass the initial screening will undergo a review DD by our committee, including interviews and constructive feedback. This process is conducted on a rolling basis, ensuring ongoing evaluation and an even distribution of workload throughout the entire term.   
- **Award & Monitoring:** Once approved, projects receive funding and kick off their work, with periodic check-ins and a concluding evaluation to measure impact and success. 



### ( C) Due Diligence

Our due diligence process aims to be a robust evaluation system that combines the rigor of early-stage investing with strategic alignment to Uniswap's goals. After the initial screening, we will focus on the following elements: 

- **Team Assessment:** We evaluate the project's team, considering qualifications, experience, and track record to gauge their ability to execute their vision effectively.
- **Impact Assessment:** We evaluate the potential impact of the project on the Uniswap and Arbitrum ecosystems, ensuring alignment with our grant program's values. Here we consider the technological potential of the project, as well as its potential application areas. 
- **Risk Assessment:** We identify and assess various risks, including market, technology, and execution risks, to gauge the project's risk mitigation strategies effectively. 

Following the evaluation using the aforementioned dimensions, projects proceed through the subsequent internal governance procedure:

- **Final Approval by Reviewer Committee:** The committee uses a form to give a 'yes' or 'no' to each grant application, requesting references as part of the assessment.
- **Strategic Funding Focus:** Our grants are aimed at projects that have a substantive impact on the protocol's growth and effectiveness (vs. wide range of small grants). 
- **Ask for continuous feedback from UF:** To prevent breaking points in communication and objectives, we aim to get continuous feedback on our funding decisions from the Uniswap Foundation.



### (D) Selection Process & Reporting

Transparency and continuous dialogue form the backbone of our selection and reporting process, ensuring that each grantee remains aligned with program expectations.

- **Monthly Reports**: We will provide monthly updates on our selections and updates on funded projects. These updates will include general project trajectory and progress toward milestones. To create the reports we will set regular monthly check-in dates where grantees fill a template/slide in order to give the key info about the project’s status, such as:
  - Summary of Achievements for the Month
  - Funds Utilized 
  - Milestones Reached
  - Challenges Faced
  - Upcoming Goals
 

- **Output Metrics:** With the initial priorities in mind, some effective measures for meaningful output will look as follows:

  - **Number of Grants Distributed:** Number of grants that were awarded during a defined time period (3m, 6m).
  - **Total Funds Allocated:** Cumulative sum of funds distributed over a particular time frame, showcasing the program's financial impact.
  - **Milestone Completion Rate:** Calculated as the number of successfully achieved project milestones divided by the total number of milestones, multiplied by 100, to evaluate the effectiveness of grant-supported initiatives.

- **Outcome Metrics:** Depending on the final portfolio of funded projects, we will gauge the success rate of grantees through specific outcome metrics. While these metrics can be influenced by a wide range of external factors, such as market conditions and individual decisions on project level, we are committed to supporting and funding the most promising projects to the best of our ability. Metrics include:
   - **Community Satisfaction Score:** An average score ranging from 1 to 10, gathered from community feedback surveys.
   - **Protocol Integrations:** The number of blockchain protocols or projects that successfully integrate with Uniswap on Arbitrum as a result of the grants program.
   - **Usage of Tools funded:** Measuring the adoption and usage of tools and infrastructure funded by the grants program. This could include metrics such as the number of developers using these tools or the volume of transactions processed through them.
   - **Net New Liquidity Providers (LPs):** Tracking the increase in the number of liquidity providers within the Uniswap on Arbitrum ecosystem. This metric reflects the program's impact on attracting new participants to contribute liquidity.



### (E) Project Allocation & Support

Our approach to grant allocation focuses on achieving high impact, which we believe comes from bigger, more substantial projects:

- **Focus on $50-250k High-Impact Projects:** Our grant allocation strategy prioritizes projects with the potential for significant impact. We concentrate our financial support in the $50,000 to $250,000 ARB range.
- **Providing Non-financial Support:** Offer more than just funding by assisting selected projects with selective strategic guidance,  and other key areas that contribute to long-term success.
- **Discord Support Channel:** We aim to establish a dedicated Discord channel for project to project exchange and bi-monthly office hours for direct support interactions.


### (F) Team Set-up

Our committee aims to create an efficient and predictable grant application and decision process.

- **5 committee members:** 1 operational lead and 5 reviewers (incl. ops lead)
- **Terms and Renewal:** Committee members serve for 6-month terms, requiring a renewal process overseen by UNI governance.
- **Nomination and Election Process:** When this proposal has passed, the 2 week nomination and election process for the remaining members will be kicked off. 

The **Grant Program’s initial team** will be made up of the following individuals:

- **Operational Lead -** [**@bernard**](https://gov.uniswap.org/u/bernard) **(web3 Studios - Crypto-native advisory)** \
  Experience: Ex-McKinsey Consultant and Founder of w3s.

- **Grant Reviewer -** [**@Doo\_Stablelab**](https://gov.uniswap.org/u/doo_stablelab) **- Doo Wan Nam (COO at StableLab, Uniswap Deployment Accountability Committee)**Experience: Professional delegate at StableLab across major DeFi protocols, including MakerDAO, Optimism, Aave, 1inch, Balancer, Element, InstaDapp, Hop. Previously spent 3.5 years at the Maker Foundation. Participation in an Accountability Working Group that shipped [Proposal Template 2.0 - Upgrade for Deployments & Agreements](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/proposal-template-2-0-upgrade-for-deployments-agreements/19936)

Once this proposal is approved, the 2-week voting period will be initiated to fill the remaining 3 spots, where individuals interested in becoming reviewers can nominate themselves by responding to the Election Forum post (will be created separately).


### (G) Governance

The UAGP governance aims for transparency, efficiency, and broad community involvement. It outlines mechanisms to ensure fair and balanced decision-making for all stakeholders.

- **Multi-sig:** Committee functions as a 4 of 5 multi-sig
- **Term Limits and Renewals:** Each committee member serves a term of two quarters (6 months). At the end of each term, the effectiveness and impact of the UAGP will be reviewed by UNI governance.
- **Grant Allocation:** Proposals to allocate Grants can be initiated by any committee member and will be shared internally to vote on. 


## Budget and Compensation

**1.1 million (25% of the total airdrop) $ARB tokens are requested for UNI-ARB Grants.** While the vast majority of the funds will be allocated to grants, some operations costs need to be addressed.

After reviewing other best-known Grant Programs like [Aave](https://governance.aave.com/t/updated-proposal-aave-grants-dao-renewal/11289) and the [UGP](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-create-the-uniswap-foundation/17358), we decided to propose the following compensation package for core members:

- Operational Lead: 100 $ARB/hr, capped at 25 hrs/week
- Review committee: 100 $ARB/hr, capped at 10 hrs/week

Below, we put down a budget estimation for the next 6 months, considering 3 budget categories: grants itself, compensation and maintenance costs.

**Budget (6 months)**

|                                                         |                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| **Category**                                            | **Amount (ARB)** |
| Expected Grants to Award                                | 924,000          |
| **Grants Total Budgeted Cost**                          | **924,000**      |
| Max Compensation                                        | 156,000          |
| Budget for tooling, subscriptions, and misc             | 20,000           |
| **Operations Max Budgeted Cost**                        | **176,000**      |
| **Total UAGP Budget**                                   | **1,100,000**    |


We recognize that workload varies across different phases of the cycle. For instance, the selection phase may require peak capacity, while other stages could be less demanding. As a result, we've estimated an average commitment of 25 hours per week for the operational lead and 10 hours per week for the review committee 

## Case studies:

To better articulate the scope and focus of the UAGP, we've incorporated case studies in response to feedback received from Uni delegates during our iterative process. These case studies aim to make our target projects more tangible and offer insights into what we mean by projects that strengthen the Uniswap-Arbitrum ecosystem.

1. ### Li.Fi (Uni RFC [link](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-li-fi-mma-infrastructure-development-for-uniswap/21444))

   1. <ins>Project description</ins>

      1. Advancement of MMA. The Multi-Messaging Aggregation is a bridge-agnostic solution designed for Uniswap to securely relay governance messages from Ethereum to other chains.\
         Instead of relying on a single bridge, MMA combines multiple selected bridges into a unified cross-chain framework. A governance message is sent from Ethereum to the destination chain via all these bridges and is deemed valid only if a quorum of these bridges relayed the same message;
      2. [Three audits](https://docs.li.fi/smart-contracts/audits) and a Code4arena audit contest done so far.

    2. <ins>Benefits for Uniswap</ins>

       1. **Increased Safety**: By having a spectrum of bridges verifying governance messages, MMA offers improved security guarantees for Uniswa's cross-chain governance use case;
       2. **Liveness and Censorship Resistance**: Redundancy through multiple bridges ensures the system remains live even if one bridge fails, thus improving liveness and censorship resistance;
       3. **Flexibility and Extensibility:** MMA facilitates the integration of new bridges and allows for the phasing out of outdated ones without causing disruptions. This ensures Uniswap can access the best bridges available and avoid vendor lock-in;
       4. **Immutability and Trustlessness**: MMA is designed to be fully immutable and operates completely on-chain, which means that once Uniswap's configuration is set, it cannot be altered.


    3. <ins>Scope</ins>
        Planned timeline for use of funds is 12 months (including 6 months for a v2 release of this project).


2. ### Flashstake (Uni RFC [Iink](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-flashstake-enabling-upfront-yield-for-uniswap-liquidity-v2-v3))

   1. <ins>Project description</ins>
      1. Flashstake offers a unique mechanism where users receive immediate upfront returns on their investments. Leveraging a blend of interest rate swaps and a market dedicated to the time value of money, Flashstake ensures a consistent yield rate, disbursing the returns to the investor right at the outset;
      2. This protocol is currently live on Ethereum Mainnet, Arbitrum and Optimism;
      3. Flashtake received a grant from [AAVE Grants DAO](https://aavegrants.mirror.xyz/gon0JE4BxQqzuKJ72jIcwcQQyq41sF9jNP_CkEJ-vq0);

    2. <ins>Benefits for Uniswap</ins>
       1. **New functionality for LPs:** current Uni V2-V3 LPs will be able to Flashstake to earn instant upfront yield;
       2. **More TVL streamed:** upon yield LPs incentives, there could be larger amounts of liquidity locked for extended periods of time;
       3. **Migration from V2 to V3**: Uniswap V2 tokens are supported, helping to migrate to Uniswap V3.

    3. <ins>Scope</ins>
        Planned timeline for use of funds is 1 to 3 months.

# 2. Protocol Delegate Program

In our effort to create a well-defined delegate program, we at took a systematic approach. Our initial step involved breaking down the Delegate Program into basic components to better understand its core ideas. Subsequently, we closely examined other successful Delegate Programs like Arbitrum, Optimism, Synthetix Ambassador Council, Rari, and Stader to identify effective strategies.

To gain deeper insights, we engaged with 6 experts in delegate programs. This allowed us to learn more and incorporate the best industry practices. This collaborative and iterative research led us to develop a robust UNI-ARB Delegate Program.  


## Summary

- **Remaining ~1.1 million (25% of the total airdrop) ARB tokens is requested for Governance -** Empowering the committee to actively participate in Arbitrum governance and influence strategic decisions.
- To ensure effective representation, a **committee of 2 members** will serve as dedicated representatives of the Uniswap community’s interests
- The **success of the program will be evaluated based on how satisfied the community is, how much the delegates participate in decision-making, and if their choices match Uniswap's values**.


## Program Format

To secure adequate representation, a committee comprising 2 members is instituted to act as committed proponents of the Uniswap community's interests. This committee's sole responsibility is to advocate for Uniswap, guaranteeing unbiased decision-making. The primary aim is to actively participate in Arbitrum governance, enabling the Uniswap community to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of the ecosystem.


## Delegate Program Design & Approach

As previously highlighted, a parallel methodology was employed to ascertain the optimal Program structure. Comprising five fundamental pillars, the primary framework encompasses the entirety of the core process. Find detailed research here [Delegate Program Research](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Idp35yZmHIPMDVg9OGpbWyTDtf7-ko1l/view?usp=sharing)

These pillars are represented on the following image:

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/bENLJqXuYi_Fch9K1CYSitzoCM_MRll-Ukx1Aa5LNmogiR_Ha1pbPSdzH9XtmJ7L5jUHXHUAOYyIMvkLn7KwS821tJnoF5vD6lfXr5s5FrGt_rzOE7A-oIH0i_Q-OiC25vd7OdIJMQpLkdKf)


### (A) Objectives and Criteria

The Uni-Arb Delegate Working Group will transparently and accountability represent the Uniswap community’s interests in the Arbitrum DAO. Potential responsibilities will include:

- Participation in voting discussions
- Voting participation through multi-sig
- Attendance at bi-weekly community calls


### (B) Delegates Application Process

The program holds elections on a semiannual basis. During this time, the community members who participate in Uniswap governance vote to select the delegates who will represent them for the next 6 months.

One of the WG0 members has been selected based on the criteria listed below, but we invite community members to nominate themselves below to fill the rest of the total multi-sig spots. Self-nomination will happen on this forum post, and the UF will host a Snapshot vote to determine these 2 members.

Prospective delegates submit various information about themselves based on the following criteria:

- Strong familiarity and prior experience with DAO governance structures and processes.
- A demonstrated understanding of both the Uniswap protocol and the Arbitrum protocol, showcasing a comprehensive grasp of the technical aspects.
- A commitment to being an engaged and participatory delegate, aligned with the declared availability and bandwidth to fulfil the responsibilities effectively.
- Eligibility requires not currently having any existing delegations within the Arbitrum ecosystem. This ensures a diverse range of perspectives and prevents the concentration of influence.

Once the proposal is approved and a specific nomination process post is created, members will be asked to make use of the[ official Delegate Statement Template](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/delegate-statement-template/31) to fill out the application and post their response on the forum. 

**Current committee (part of WG0)**

- **Jun Sun (Uniswap Deployment Accountability Committee, Delegate)** [**@Juanbug**](https://gov.uniswap.org/u/juanbug) Experience: On current Uniswap Deployment Accountability Committee, Led Penn Blockchain governance for 2 years, Delegate at Uniswap, Compound, Optimism, etc; Helped draft, steward, and submit various cross-chain deployment proposals, Co-authored a research paper Deep Diving into Uniswap’s Governance with recommendations on reinvigorating governance activity.


### ( C) Election/Voting Process

Once this proposal is approved, the 2-week voting period will be initiated, where individuals interested in becoming delegates can nominate themselves by following the application process outlined above.

1. Community members then have the opportunity to select their preferred delegate through the Uniswap Governance platform.
2. Upon successful selection, candidates are obligated to fulfil KYC requirements to proceed with their delegate responsibilities.


### (D) Governance

- The commitment to Arbitrum governance spans six months.
- Full participation in voting discussions is a mandatory expectation for each participant.
- Maintaining 100% voting participation via multi-signature is a core requirement.
- The rationale behind the committee's voting decisions will be openly shared through communication threads for both Arbitrum and Uniswap delegates.
- Active engagement involves attendance at bi-weekly community calls, jointly organised by fellow Arbitrum delegates.
- Specific details outlining expectations will be communicated directly with committee members subsequent to the conclusion of the voting phase.

The UADP governance likewise aims for transparency, efficiency, and broad community involvement. It outlines mechanisms to ensure fair and balanced decision-making for all stakeholders.

- **Multi-sig:** Delegate Program functions as a 2 of 3 multi-sig. 2 of the signers will be the 2 delegates and the other will be the grants program operational lead. The operational lead will be there for operational and transition support, and the 2 delegates will be tasked with consistently submitting the votes.
- **Term Limits and Renewals:** Each committee member serves a term of two quarters (6 months) before being put up for reconsideration.


### (E) Voting Record Reflection

When it comes to tracking how delegates vote, the current approach, used by different DAOs, involves looking at their voting history during specific times linked to their election cycle. This helps the community decide if they should be re-elected based on how they've voted. However, it can be tough to figure out if their voting really matches the program's main goals, especially when things aren't clear-cut.

To address this, the UNI-ARB Delegate Program will hold elections twice a year to check if delegates are doing what's expected of them regularly. This way, we can prevent problems and give the community chances to set new expectations over time. The evaluation will be based on how satisfied the community is, how much the delegates participate in making decisions, and if their choices match Uniswap's values.


## Budget and Compensation

Like the UNI-ARB grants program, ~1.1 million (25% of the total airdrop) $ARB tokens are requested for the UNI-ARB Delegate program. Due to the nature of delegation technically, the remaining funds in the Arbitrum community wallet will be delegated in an all or nothing transaction. These funds will be delegated to the Delegate Program wallet and will stay in the community wallet; some operational costs will be addressed. Similar to the grant program, we have capped each delegate to a maximum of 10 hrs/week for a 6 month maximum total of $48k, which translates to just under ~50k $ARB. In reality, the final amount should be less. A small portion will also be earmarked as a reserve fund in case legal and similar expenses arise. Please note that until ARB is used as an expense, our goal is to have all of the ARB be self-delegated.

**Budget (6 months)**

Below, we put down a similar “budget” estimation for the next 6 months. 

|                                                                                                                                         |                  |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| **Category**                                                                                                                            | **Amount (ARB)** |
| ARB left in community wallet for self-delegation (~1 million)                                                                             | 0                |
| Max Compensation (Will be self-delegated whilst sitting idle)                                                                           | 50,000           |
| Reserve: Legal expenses if applicable, gas reimbursements, delegation smart contract, etc. (Will be self-delegated whilst sitting idle) | 50,000           |
| **Total UADP Budget**                                                                                                               | **100,000**    |


## End of WG0 Phase 1 and compensation

As previously agreed upon in the Snapshot vote, our Working Group Zero (WG0) will receive a compensation of $20,000 ARB for their efforts over the last 8-week sprint that will be split equally by its 4 members. This amount will be subtracted from the program's overall budget and will serve as the compensation for the four WG0 members.


## Conclusion

Thanks to invaluable delegate feedback, our program is aligned to fund projects that strengthen the Uniswap-Arbitrum ecosystem. 

Upon successful approval of this proposal, UAGP and the Protocol Delegate Program will initiate a 2-week nomination and election process.

We're excited to kick this off and sincerely believe that, with the involvement of our delegates, we can set a precedent for streamlined, effective grant programs that make a significant difference.


## Next Steps

- Upon approval of the on-chain vote, funds will be transferred to a multi-sig wallet, co-managed by the named parties and Erin from the UF, to cover contributor compensation.

In light of the Uniswap DAO’s vote to deploy on the Polygon zkEVM (Tally | Uniswap Proposal 10), we propose a partnership between the Uniswap DAO and Zero Protocol. This collaboration centers on the concept of a “friendly fork.”

A friendly fork refers to the creation of a new version of an existing protocol that retains a cooperative and synergistic relationship with the original. Unlike contentious forks, which often lead to competitive divergence, a friendly fork seeks to align with the parent protocol.

In this context, the below proposal will outline how the partnership entails integrating Zero Protocol as a friendly fork of Uniswap on the Polygon zkEVM chain. Zero Protocol will utilize Uniswap’s established backend infrastructure as its foundational engine and be granted access to ecosystem funded tooling. To align interests, the DAO will benefit from the open R&D taking place and receive a 10% token allocation detailed below. This approach resonates with Uniswap V2’s historical challenges of dealing with competitive forks and this scenario into an opportunity.

# Overview of proposal
## Description:

We propose a visionary partnership between the Uniswap DAO and Zero Protocol, focusing on the integration of Zero Protocol as a friendly fork of Uniswap on the Polygon zkEVM chain. This collaboration draws inspiration from Uniswap V2’s history and aims to transform past challenges into future opportunities. By leveraging this partnership, Uniswap can harness the advantages of Zero Protocol while ensuring that both projects benefit mutually and contribute to the evolving DeFi landscape.

## What is Zero:
Zero Protocol introduces an innovative ve(3,3) decentralized exchange (DEX) concept that aims to optimize the efficiency and sustainability of liquidity for protocols and liquidity providers on Polygon zkEVM. Utilizing Uniswap V3 as its core trading engine, Zero Protocol distinguishes itself by building unique infrastructure and features around this foundation.

Zero is a direct fork of the existing Retro project on Polygon POS, which already relies on Uniswap V3 for trading. Using Angle Lab’s Merkl SaaS, we have been able to create a unique emissions distribution system which allows integration of multiple Active Liquidity Managers via Zero’s ALM Marketplace for liquidity management, a first in the DeFi space.

Zero has recently recieved a grant from Polygon to help bootstrap liquidity on the chain.

## Since Retro’s launch on July 27th:

TVL is at an ATH of ~$15M
Volume from most recent epoch ~$40M
Average voter APR for veRETRO holders - ~150%
$RETRO market cap has more than tripled from $2M at launch to over $7M today
A straight 1:1 fork of UniV3 will also be the engine behind Zero Protocol (with fee changes made)

Retro is currently the most advanced version of any ve(3,3) AMM in the entire DeFi space.

Retro has grown very quickly into the third-largest fork of Uniswap V3, as measured by Defillama, underscoring the potential impact of Zero and showcasing its relevance within a new up-and-coming chain like Polygon zkEVM, which has already passed a vote by the Uniswap DAO.

## What is a friendly fork?
A friendly fork refers to a situation in which a protocol is duplicated, creating a new version that maintains a positive and collaborative relationship with the original project. Unlike contentious forks that often result in divergent and competitive paths, a friendly fork aims to work in harmony with the parent project, often for the purpose of introducing improvements, innovations, or addressing specific use cases. The intention behind a friendly fork is to foster collaboration, open-source development, and a sense of shared goals, rather than creating a rift or competition between the two versions.

Examples of friendly forks formed previously in DeFi ecosystem:

Balancer <> BeethovenX

Liquity <> Gravita

Platypus <> Hummus

Thena <> Retro

While a friendly fork prioritizes collaboration and shared success, it does not fall under Uniswap DAO and its governance.

## Tokenomics

1600×900 106 KB
Context and Learning from Uniswap V2:
Uniswap V2’s success and widespread adoption led to numerous forks without providing significant returns to Uniswap or its community. The expiration of Uniswap V3’s business license presents a unique opportunity to learn from this history and establish a more rewarding framework. Our proposal envisions a symbiotic approach where Uniswap V3 and Zero Protocol can share in the successes of their joint ventures, ensuring that value is generated for both parties.

## Revenue Generation and Token Allocation:

To cement the mutually beneficial nature of this partnership, we propose that Uniswap receives a percentage of the initial token allocation of Zero Protocol. This enables Uniswap to participate in governance decisions and generate revenue through voting, ensuring active engagement and sustained collaboration. This aligns with the spirit of reciprocity and incentivizes both projects to contribute to each other’s growth.

## Timeline:

We suggest a structured proposal timeline spanning 3 weeks to ensure transparency, community engagement, and thoughtful decision-making. The timeline would be broken into 3 phases:

Phase 1 Forum Post (Done)

Phase 2 Temperature Check (Passed)

Phase 3 Onchain Vote

We plan on launching Zero on Polygon zkEVM with Polygon’s support at the beginning of October.

## Motivation for Uniswap
Uniswap V2 undeniably emerged as a groundbreaking protocol within the DeFi space, a sentiment echoed by the surge in its adoption and the remarkable number of forks that it has catalyzed over the last few years. The resilience and appeal of Uniswap V2’s technology are evidenced by the fact that it continues to maintain the highest Total Value Locked (TVL) combined across all forked categories. This achievement underscores its robustness and adaptability, with numerous projects leveraging its core mechanics to create innovative variations within the decentralized exchange landscape.

However, despite the proliferation of Uniswap V2 forks and their significant TVL, there has been a missed opportunity for the Uniswap community and UNI token holders to capitalize on this phenomenon. While the DeFi ecosystem has witnessed a multitude of derivative projects utilizing Uniswap’s core technology, there has been a lack of active engagement from Uniswap and its stakeholders in reaping the benefits of these forks.

This narrative presents a pivotal juncture as Uniswap V3 takes center stage with the business license expired. By learning from the past and recognizing the value inherent in its technology, the Uniswap DAO has the potential to revolutionize its approach to forks. Rather than allowing forks to flourish independently, there is a strategic avenue for Uniswap V3 to foster a symbiotic relationship with these derivatives. Through the introduction of a friendly fork status, the Uniswap DAO can transform forks into partners, encouraging them to contribute to the Uniswap ecosystem while simultaneously capitalizing on value capture allowing for independent forks to collectively reap rewards.

By strategically collaborating with these forks, Uniswap V3 can capture value from the derivatives built on its technology while fostering a stronger sense of community and collaboration within the DeFi landscape. This proactive approach aligns with the vision of maximizing the potential of Uniswap’s technology and positioning it as a trailblazer in the evolution of decentralized exchanges. Ultimately, taking this transformative step can lead to a more dynamic and prosperous future for Uniswap and its stakeholders.

## Delegate Sponsor
“GFX Labs is sponsoring the proposal because we believe it is a strong opportunity for the DAO to solidify a process for friendly forks and continue Uniswap’s multi-chain expansion.”

Additional information for cross-chain deployments
We believe this is the right moment for ZERO (UniV3 friendly fork) to deploy on Polygon zkEVM. ZERO will be the liquidity layer for Polygon zkEVM, bootstrapping liquidity for new and existing projects on chain or migrating to zkEVM.

The friendly fork to Polygon zkEVM would not only capitalize on the compatibility with Ethereum smart contracts but also benefit from the scalability features offered by Polygon’s zkEVM. Polygon zkEVM, an open-source ZK-Rollup, delivers a hassle-free user experience with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility. It flawlessly integrates with pre-existing smart contracts, developer tools, and wallets. Leveraging the strength of ZK proofs, Polygon zkEVM significantly reduces transaction expenses and substantially boosts transaction speed, while also adopting Ethereum’s robust security. As previously mentioned, a proposal has already been passed 10 signaling intent to move to this chain.

## Benefits:

Launching Zero, a direct fork of Retro, on Polygon zkEVM grants additional exposure and credibility to both protocols - allowing the total to be greater than the sum of its parts.
Using a proven, successful ve(3,3) model on zkEVM at this early stage of the chain’s lifetime allows Zero Protocol to capture a significant portion of liquidity and volume on the chain.
## Engagement Terms
Uniswap DAO acknowledges Zero Protocol on Polygon zkEVM as “friendly fork” of Uniswap v3 and as such is considered an auxiliary member of the Uniswap Ecosystem. Zero Protocol would be afforded access to all existing and future tooling for Uniswap v3 which has been granted by UF previously; i.e OkuTrade, Seedle.finance and Uniswap.fish.

In return for the cooperation and exclusive friendly fork status on Polygon zkEVM, Zero will allocate 10% of the initial token allocation to the Uniswap DAO.

-10% of initial supply will be streamed to the Uniswap treasury address upon launch as a veZERO veNFT locked for 2 years (5,000,000 veZERO). This includes a 30% veZERO rebase for the first 90 days, and a 15% rebase thereafter to avoid dilution of the veZERO position.

## Project Financing
Zero Protocol’s commitment and intention is to embark on this partnership without seeking any funding from Uniswap. Zero Protocol’s willingness to bear all the costs associated with the launch and operation on zkEVM showcases the dedication and belief in the potential of this collaboration.

This self-sufficient approach not only underscores the sincerity of their engagement but also emphasizes their long-term vision for building a thriving ecosystem on Polygon zkEVM. Such an approach aligns with the spirit of mutual growth and innovation, setting a strong foundation for a partnership that places collaboration and shared success at the forefront.

## Conclusion:
This proposal introduces a transformative chapter for Uniswap as it provides the protocol an opportunity to pioneer a more collaborative approach to leveraging the revolutionary technology that it has created.

Integrating Zero Protocol as the first ever official friendly fork on Polygon zkEVM and establishing a fair revenue-sharing mechanism empowers Uniswap to not only expand on its innovative ecosystem but also establish a fruitful precedent of friendly fork partnerships. This benefits both individual projects and the DeFi community at large.

This proposal exemplifies a forward-thinking strategy to shape the future of decentralized exchanges, with collaboration, reciprocity, and shared growth at its core."

## Proposal summary
In light of the Uniswap DAO’s vote to deploy on the Polygon zkEVM (Tally | Uniswap Proposal 10), we propose a partnership between the Uniswap DAO and Zero Protocol. This collaboration centers on the concept of a “friendly fork.”

A friendly fork refers to the creation of a new version of an existing protocol that retains a cooperative and synergistic relationship with the original. Unlike contentious forks, which often lead to competitive divergence, a friendly fork seeks to align with the parent protocol.

In this context, the below proposal will outline how the partnership entails integrating Zero Protocol as a friendly fork of Uniswap on the Polygon zkEVM chain. Zero Protocol will utilize Uniswap’s established backend infrastructure as its foundational engine and be granted access to ecosystem funded tooling. To align interests, the DAO will benefit from the open R&D taking place and receive a 10% token allocation detailed below. This approach resonates with Uniswap V2’s historical challenges of dealing with competitive forks and this scenario into an opportunity.

# Overview of proposal
## Description:

We propose a visionary partnership between the Uniswap DAO and Zero Protocol, focusing on the integration of Zero Protocol as a friendly fork of Uniswap on the Polygon zkEVM chain. This collaboration draws inspiration from Uniswap V2’s history and aims to transform past challenges into future opportunities. By leveraging this partnership, Uniswap can harness the advantages of Zero Protocol while ensuring that both projects benefit mutually and contribute to the evolving DeFi landscape.

## What is Zero:
Zero Protocol introduces an innovative ve(3,3) decentralized exchange (DEX) concept that aims to optimize the efficiency and sustainability of liquidity for protocols and liquidity providers on Polygon zkEVM. Utilizing Uniswap V3 as its core trading engine, Zero Protocol distinguishes itself by building unique infrastructure and features around this foundation.

Zero is a direct fork of the existing Retro project on Polygon POS, which already relies on Uniswap V3 for trading. Using Angle Lab’s Merkl SaaS, we have been able to create a unique emissions distribution system which allows integration of multiple Active Liquidity Managers via Zero’s ALM Marketplace for liquidity management, a first in the DeFi space.

Zero has recently recieved a grant from Polygon to help bootstrap liquidity on the chain.

## Since Retro’s launch on July 27th:

TVL is at an ATH of ~$15M
Volume from most recent epoch ~$40M
Average voter APR for veRETRO holders - ~150%
$RETRO market cap has more than tripled from $2M at launch to over $7M today
A straight 1:1 fork of UniV3 will also be the engine behind Zero Protocol (with fee changes made)

Retro is currently the most advanced version of any ve(3,3) AMM in the entire DeFi space.

Retro has grown very quickly into the third-largest fork of Uniswap V3, as measured by Defillama, underscoring the potential impact of Zero and showcasing its relevance within a new up-and-coming chain like Polygon zkEVM, which has already passed a vote by the Uniswap DAO.

## What is a friendly fork?
A friendly fork refers to a situation in which a protocol is duplicated, creating a new version that maintains a positive and collaborative relationship with the original project. Unlike contentious forks that often result in divergent and competitive paths, a friendly fork aims to work in harmony with the parent project, often for the purpose of introducing improvements, innovations, or addressing specific use cases. The intention behind a friendly fork is to foster collaboration, open-source development, and a sense of shared goals, rather than creating a rift or competition between the two versions.

Examples of friendly forks formed previously in DeFi ecosystem:

Balancer <> BeethovenX

Liquity <> Gravita

Platypus <> Hummus

Thena <> Retro

While a friendly fork prioritizes collaboration and shared success, it does not fall under Uniswap DAO and its governance.

## Tokenomics

1600×900 106 KB
Context and Learning from Uniswap V2:
Uniswap V2’s success and widespread adoption led to numerous forks without providing significant returns to Uniswap or its community. The expiration of Uniswap V3’s business license presents a unique opportunity to learn from this history and establish a more rewarding framework. Our proposal envisions a symbiotic approach where Uniswap V3 and Zero Protocol can share in the successes of their joint ventures, ensuring that value is generated for both parties.

## Revenue Generation and Token Allocation:

To cement the mutually beneficial nature of this partnership, we propose that Uniswap receives a percentage of the initial token allocation of Zero Protocol. This enables Uniswap to participate in governance decisions and generate revenue through voting, ensuring active engagement and sustained collaboration. This aligns with the spirit of reciprocity and incentivizes both projects to contribute to each other’s growth.

## Timeline:

We suggest a structured proposal timeline spanning 3 weeks to ensure transparency, community engagement, and thoughtful decision-making. The timeline would be broken into 3 phases:

Phase 1 Forum Post (Done)

Phase 2 Temperature Check (Passed)

Phase 3 Onchain Vote

We plan on launching Zero on Polygon zkEVM with Polygon’s support at the beginning of October.

## Motivation for Uniswap
Uniswap V2 undeniably emerged as a groundbreaking protocol within the DeFi space, a sentiment echoed by the surge in its adoption and the remarkable number of forks that it has catalyzed over the last few years. The resilience and appeal of Uniswap V2’s technology are evidenced by the fact that it continues to maintain the highest Total Value Locked (TVL) combined across all forked categories. This achievement underscores its robustness and adaptability, with numerous projects leveraging its core mechanics to create innovative variations within the decentralized exchange landscape.

However, despite the proliferation of Uniswap V2 forks and their significant TVL, there has been a missed opportunity for the Uniswap community and UNI token holders to capitalize on this phenomenon. While the DeFi ecosystem has witnessed a multitude of derivative projects utilizing Uniswap’s core technology, there has been a lack of active engagement from Uniswap and its stakeholders in reaping the benefits of these forks.

This narrative presents a pivotal juncture as Uniswap V3 takes center stage with the business license expired. By learning from the past and recognizing the value inherent in its technology, the Uniswap DAO has the potential to revolutionize its approach to forks. Rather than allowing forks to flourish independently, there is a strategic avenue for Uniswap V3 to foster a symbiotic relationship with these derivatives. Through the introduction of a friendly fork status, the Uniswap DAO can transform forks into partners, encouraging them to contribute to the Uniswap ecosystem while simultaneously capitalizing on value capture allowing for independent forks to collectively reap rewards.

By strategically collaborating with these forks, Uniswap V3 can capture value from the derivatives built on its technology while fostering a stronger sense of community and collaboration within the DeFi landscape. This proactive approach aligns with the vision of maximizing the potential of Uniswap’s technology and positioning it as a trailblazer in the evolution of decentralized exchanges. Ultimately, taking this transformative step can lead to a more dynamic and prosperous future for Uniswap and its stakeholders.

## Delegate Sponsor
“GFX Labs is sponsoring the proposal because we believe it is a strong opportunity for the DAO to solidify a process for friendly forks and continue Uniswap’s multi-chain expansion.”

Additional information for cross-chain deployments
We believe this is the right moment for ZERO (UniV3 friendly fork) to deploy on Polygon zkEVM. ZERO will be the liquidity layer for Polygon zkEVM, bootstrapping liquidity for new and existing projects on chain or migrating to zkEVM.

The friendly fork to Polygon zkEVM would not only capitalize on the compatibility with Ethereum smart contracts but also benefit from the scalability features offered by Polygon’s zkEVM. Polygon zkEVM, an open-source ZK-Rollup, delivers a hassle-free user experience with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility. It flawlessly integrates with pre-existing smart contracts, developer tools, and wallets. Leveraging the strength of ZK proofs, Polygon zkEVM significantly reduces transaction expenses and substantially boosts transaction speed, while also adopting Ethereum’s robust security. As previously mentioned, a proposal has already been passed 10 signaling intent to move to this chain.

## Benefits:

Launching Zero, a direct fork of Retro, on Polygon zkEVM grants additional exposure and credibility to both protocols - allowing the total to be greater than the sum of its parts.
Using a proven, successful ve(3,3) model on zkEVM at this early stage of the chain’s lifetime allows Zero Protocol to capture a significant portion of liquidity and volume on the chain.
## Engagement Terms
Uniswap DAO acknowledges Zero Protocol on Polygon zkEVM as “friendly fork” of Uniswap v3 and as such is considered an auxiliary member of the Uniswap Ecosystem. Zero Protocol would be afforded access to all existing and future tooling for Uniswap v3 which has been granted by UF previously; i.e OkuTrade, Seedle.finance and Uniswap.fish.

In return for the cooperation and exclusive friendly fork status on Polygon zkEVM, Zero will allocate 10% of the initial token allocation to the Uniswap DAO.

-10% of initial supply will be streamed to the Uniswap treasury address upon launch as a veZERO veNFT locked for 2 years (5,000,000 veZERO). This includes a 30% veZERO rebase for the first 90 days, and a 15% rebase thereafter to avoid dilution of the veZERO position.

## Project Financing
Zero Protocol’s commitment and intention is to embark on this partnership without seeking any funding from Uniswap. Zero Protocol’s willingness to bear all the costs associated with the launch and operation on zkEVM showcases the dedication and belief in the potential of this collaboration.

This self-sufficient approach not only underscores the sincerity of their engagement but also emphasizes their long-term vision for building a thriving ecosystem on Polygon zkEVM. Such an approach aligns with the spirit of mutual growth and innovation, setting a strong foundation for a partnership that places collaboration and shared success at the forefront.

## Summary
We [Michigan Blockchain](https://twitter.com/UMichBlockchain) are submitting this proposal to deploy Uniswap v3 on the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM), a programmable EMV-compatible environment built over the Filecoin blockchain and its robust system of decentrally stored data. The [temperature check](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0x36a17f6c311f3d910bc11cb4cd55891a7e6c71facd04e7bffcfb267fdd88c45b) for this proposal passed with **28M (~99.9%) YES** votes and **4.6k (~0.01%) NO votes**–the proposal stakeholders were agreed upon via the RFC.

## Proposal Motivation
Considering Filecoin is the de facto storage provider in the blockchain space, it is valuable for Uniswap to attain market share in its data economy early on. We therefore believe that an FVM deployment is an opportune manner by which Uniswap’s multichain vision is furthered. 

### Uniswap’s Ability to Enhance the Decentralized Data Economy
One of the reasons that peer to peer storage systems like IPFS are difficult to maintain is because the parties involved in the network are not incentivized to expend resources to maintain the integrity of the stored data. Decentralization is not an inherent method for providing a superior storage product. That is why Filecoin was created. The Filecoin blockchain’s economic incentive structure between storage providers (SPs) and users creates a market for SPs to store and maintain data integrity over time. However, the robustness of that data economy must also be high for sustaining data storage in the long run. If SPs, for instance, do not have access to creatively expand their service provision business or efficiently put their capital to work, then their incentive to partake in the Filecoin/IPFS system is reduced.

The FVM’s launch on March 14, 2023 effectively made Filecoin programmable through the introduction of smart contracts. Programmability allows for the creation of dapps that work in tandem with the stored data. If an ecosystem of, say, DeFi applications can be built on the FVM to supplement the efforts of SPs, then the data economy is strengthened many fold. Invariably, DEXs are a rudimentary building block of a crypto economy, and just as they enable higher degrees of liquidity for numerous L1s, they will be able to provide a similar facility for Filecoin’s data economy. Uniswap would, for instance, grant SPs the ability to swap between $FIL tokens that they earn as a reward for providing their services. More DeFi use cases are mentioned in the “How the FVM is Enabling a Data Economy” section.

## A Primer on Filecoin

### Filecoin, IPFS, and Storage Helpers
Filecoin is the premier decentralized storage protocol built on top of the Interplanetary File System (IPFS). The two entities are distinct but often incorrectly conflated as one. Although Protocol Labs founded–and continues to aid in the development of–both Filecoin and IPFS, the two systems serve distinct purposes. IPFS is not a blockchain but a set of modular data addressing and networking protocols. Using IPFS, files are fragmented, hashed, and distributed amongst numerous nodes. Data distribution in a network of SPs around the world makes the system more secure than a centralized cloud storage system. Centralized servers reduce the control an individual has over their data and increases the surface area for information exploits. The hashed nature of the data allows for a secure manner of locating files using a technique known as content-addressing, which differs from the traditional location-addressing method (HTTP) used by most of the Internet. Even though data on IPFS are stored off-chain (i.e. on hardware devices), they are secure due to the combination of content-addressing and a verifiable zk-proof system present on Filecoin.

IPFS’ system allows for enterprise data centers to pledge their idle network resources like bandwidth and disk drive to secure others’ data. Such a storage system, however, does not function effectively without an incentive structure in place. Monetarily rewarding the entities involved in the file storage and retrieval processes enables the creation of a micro economy, where storage providers (SPs) are paid by users to store their data. Filecoin is the blockchain-based economic layer built on top of IPFS that allows for the exchange of $FIL tokens between SPs and users. Without Filecoin’s incentive structure, the storage provision capabilities of IPFS would not function or scale. Filecoin also allows for the development of a competitive data storage market, where storage prices are more attractive than those issued by incumbent centralized SPs like AWS or Microsoft Azure. By tapping the long tail of data centers, costs for storage, compute, and retrieval can be brought dramatically below the cloud incumbents

Data storage and retrieval is also simplified through the help of third-party storage helpers. These entities aid in abstracting away much of the protocol’s dealmaking complexities between SPs and users. Instead of interacting directly with Filecoin and IPFS, developers can leverage storage helpers’ API services. Dapps can therefore receive decentralized storage benefits without much hassle. This is one of the reasons why the active number of deals, including those from [Filecoin Plus](https://docs.filecoin.io/basics/how-storage-works/filecoin-plus/), rose from [~16M to ~33M](https://observablehq.com/@starboard/chart-daily-active-deal-count-statistics) in 2023 alone. A notable storage helper called NFT.storage allows anybody using NFTs to decentrally store and retrieve their NFT metadata and images on IPFS and Filecoin. Used by platforms like OpenSea and Magic Eden, the helper has experienced over [122M total uploads, accounting for 304.13 TB of data on Filecoin](https://nft.storage/stats/).

### Proof of Storage
SPs are only paid when they submit two types of cryptographic proofs to the Filecoin protocol: Proof of Replication (PoRep) & Proof of Spacetime (PoSt). Collectively, these two proofs can be thought of as a means by which storage is proved. PoRep is initially conducted upon the SP receiving the users data, and it requires the SP to generate a public proof signifying that the hashed data is securely stored and replicated on a hardware device. It is a way to make sure that SP does not lie about the fact that they are storing the given data. PoSt is a process that occurs every 24 hours–it requires SPs to prove that a designated parcel of data is still stored (space) and able to be retrieved by the user whenever they desire (time). Daily spacetime proofs allow for the protocol to ensure data continuity. Currently, the network maintains [12.11 EiBs ](https://dashboard.starboard.ventures/capacity-services) of storage space, provided by [over 4,000 SPs](https://medium.com/tldrfilecoin/state-and-direction-of-filecoin-summarized-4b90c59e3cca).

Mere storage provision, however, is not a useful metric in and of itself because there must be demand present for the supplied storage. Although Q1 saw a decline in total storage provided, there was a 105% increase in the utilization rate, which is a more significant figure for displaying network activity.

Every SP has to collateralize a bond of $FIL tokens. Malicious and reckless SP behavior is thwarted by subjecting the bond to slashing; block rewards are also slashed in similar circumstances. Inability to generate a PoSt proof therefore has monetary consequences. The current stake that Filecoin SPs have put forth as collateral amounts to ~ 144M FIL tokens.

The other side of the Filecoin data economy is the retrieval system. Users must pay retrieval providers using $FIL to retrieve their data from the storage providers. Current systems like [Filecoin Saturn](https://saturn.tech/#contact) enable a decentralized Content Delivery Network (CDN) for data retrieval. This process is continually being iterated to be made more efficient.

## The Filecoin Virtual Machine

### How the FVM is Enabling a Data Economy

Due to the V18 Hygge Filecoin network upgrade in March 2023, smart contract programmability was introduced to the Filecoin blockchain. The FVM is a WASM-based execution environment that has the potential to enable programmable markets for storage, retrieval, compute, and Filecoin subnets, each catering to a new custom service. Foreign runtimes like the EVM are able to function on top of the FVM, allowing for developers to seamlessly program applications on Filecoin. Over time, multiple runtime environments will be introduced to the FVM, but the primary runtime that is currently available is the EVM. Solidity programmers can therefore utilize familiar tools like Hardhat, Foundry, Truffle, and Metamask to create EVM-based dapps on Filecoin, with the Filecoin complexities being abstracted from the developers’ purview. And so, with the incorporation of smart contracts, Filecoin is addressing the L1 market from the vantage point of actually being able to store users’ data; most other blockchains simply do not have the simultaneous storage capabilities and programmability.

Support for numerous VMs will enable FVM to better interact with alternative L1s and increase liquidity transmission between previously siloed chains. Programs deployed on the EVM, MoveVM, JS/SES, or any other VMs will be able to fork onto the FVM. This proposal seeks to create a fork of the Uniswap v3 code and deploy it on the FEVM.

**The FVM’s goal is to harbor a robust data economy, and this can be accomplished by launching various services, enabled by smart contract development. Below are some examples:**

***Perpetual Storage:*** Applications that allow for the automatic renewal of a deal between a client and the SPs, allowing for a continuous, long-term storage agreement that requires minimal manual intervention on behalf of the client.

***Data DAOs:*** The FVM does not have direct access to the underlying data, but it does allow for that data to be governed. DAOs can be created around a dataset, accessible by a consortium of individuals as opposed to a single entity. Token-gated structures can also allow for better dataset access controls, like determining which entities can read, write, or read+write to a dataset.

***Data Monetization:*** Data can also be tokenized, where certain tokens stand for a portion of a dataset, prescribing a market-determined value to the data underlying the respective tokens. This way, data itself can be collateralized and traded. Users of certain applications can also monetize their data by selling their profile NFTs, which give access to underlying consumer data, to marketing or analytics agencies.

***DeFi:*** A crypto economy is not complete without basic financial applications like DEXs and lending protocols. The “Proposal Motivation” section underscores why DEXs like Uniswap are important. Below are more examples of DeFi initiatives in the crypto data economy. Each of these has the ability to further enhance Uniswap’s position on Filecoin by routing liquidity between these various applications.

One example of a DeFi function is staking. Just like Lido and Rocket Pool allow ETH holders to secure the Ethereum blockchain without running a validator node with high computational and economic fixed costs, a similar model can be applied to Filecoin. A liquid staking protocol on FVM can therefore establish a profit-sharing system between SPs and $FIL holders. An alternative means for SPs to gather more $FIL for collateral purposes is by borrowing the $FIL from a lending protocol–of course, such dapps can also be built on the FVM. Token-gated features on lending dapps can also be enabled to allow for cost-effective $FIL borrowing. If an SP, for instance, has built a track record of reliable data storage with no slashing history, they can be issued an NFT by the lending protocol that gives the SP access to undercollateralized $FIL loans. Since larger amounts of data and longer storage periods require more $FIL, it is important to have seamless access to the token. This example illustrates the utilization of both DeFi and identity on the FVM.

Lending platforms and staking protocols are simply incomplete without a DEX like Uniswap. So, to provide actors in the Filecoin ecosystem with a place to easily swap between assets like $FIL and $stFIL (this asset doesn’t exist yet–just an example), there must be an AMM present. Other creative applications can also be built using Uniswap in the backend for automated asset swaps; the opportunities are very expansive.

### Ecosystem Development

Since storage is a vital part of every project, Filecoin has attracted clients of all colors from both the crypto native and web2 world. [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/), a public repository of data from documents and websites to movies and songs, utilizes Filecoin to safeguard its information. The [USC Shoah Foundation](https://sfi.usc.edu/about) also leverages Filecoin to store important historical accounts about genocides like the Holocaust. As for other blockchains, Filecoin is used by various L1s and L2s for data storage, largely through storage helpers like NFT.storage.

As of Q1 2023, the Filecoin ecosystem has [484 projects](https://messari.io/report/state-of-filecoin-q1-2023), with a trend of initiatives surpassing the initial project phase and into the accelerator stage and beyond. The Filecoin Foundation recently hosted a hackathon called [Space Warp](https://spacewarp.fvm.dev/#ie) containing over $400k of prizes and accelerator grants for promising projects building on the FVM. This was one of the initiatives to bootstrap the FVM ecosystem. Nearly two months after the FEVM’s launch, there have been [808 contracts deployed](https://dashboard.starboard.ventures/fvm) with over [130k transactions](https://dashboard.starboard.ventures/fvm) on the platform. Active contract users have also increased [184.5%](https://dashboard.starboard.ventures/fvm) since April 1st. Such activity is revitalizing the condition of Filecoin from a stance of developer interest. Over the next few months smart contract deployment is projected to increase heavily, a large shift from the past two years, during which the Filecoin [active developer count fell by 11%](http://developerreport.com/).

Overall, it is evident that the Filecoin Foundation, Protocols Labs, and their partners are aggregating resources to attract more users to the FVM. The growth thus far has been strong–but it is too early to call it a success. This Uniswap deployment, however, will certainly be another method to attract both developers and users to the FVM.

## Deployment Details

The approval of this proposal by Uniswap governance will lead the stated Uniswap v3 contracts to be deemed as the canonical deployment on the FVM. As is the case with all canonical v3 deployments, this deployment will be subject to Ethereum Layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control. The text record of the uniswap.eth ENS subdomain titled v3-deployments.uniswap.eth will be amended to include the reference to the stated v3 contracts on the FVM.

## Timeline

This proposal has passed the RFC and temperature check phases. The relevant Uniswap v3 contracts have also been deployed on the FVM. If this onchain vote passes, this deployment will be officially recognized as a canonical v3 deployment through an amendment to the v3deployments.uniswap.eth subdomain. The front-end integration for this deployment will most likely be handled by a third-party Uniswap interface like [Oku Trade](https://oku.trade/)--not by Uniswap Labs."

# Governance Proposal Updates

- As discussed below, we are requesting $46.2M of UNI. Using a 30 day TWAP price of UNI of $4.32342, this equates to a request for 10,685,984.71 UNI. 
- Simulated results of this proposal passing will be available [here](https://github.com/Uniswap/governance-seatbelt/actions) by navigating to the latest successful Governance Check workflow and downloading the Uniswap artifact at the bottom of the page.

# Temp Check Updates

**Temp Check Snapshot [here](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0xae0ff2f4cb4c1d292f7bf7c4c4bf7f4046be89518a0c7cbce65d658f2d36f20f)**

Last Wednesday we posted in the [forum](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/governance-proposal-complete-initial-funding-of-the-uniswap-foundation/21956) to complete the initial funding of the UF. Since then we’ve been having really great, thorough discussions with delegates -- hearing your comments, answering questions, and receiving feedback.

Based on that feedback, we are making a few changes to our proposal. These are covered in the bullets below, and updated throughout our proposal.

1. We have adjusted our request to reflect 2 years of operating and grants runway, with the 10% buffer to mitigate price risk. Our request is now **$46.2M**.

* We break down how this funding will be used in the post below.
* With this runway we anticipate we will return to governance for additional funding when we have approximately 1 year of runway left, in Q4 2024/ Q1 2025.

2. We will **retain** the need to receive governance approval via an off-chain vote for grants larger than $2M.
3. We have also heard feedback around the governance process being followed with this proposal. In our initial proposal, we had stated that, after approval, we would [move directly to an on-chain vote](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/governance-proposal-create-the-uniswap-foundation/17499#fund-disbursements-12) for our receipt of our second tranche of funding. However, we have heard a desire from the community for the UF to follow the [complete governance process](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/community-governance-process-update-jan-2023/19976) here. We are happy to do that, particularly considering these additional changes.

* We will consider last week’s post to be our [RFC](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/governance-proposal-complete-initial-funding-of-the-uniswap-foundation/21956/15).
* This post will be our Temperature Check. The Temp Check Snapshot is [here](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0xae0ff2f4cb4c1d292f7bf7c4c4bf7f4046be89518a0c7cbce65d658f2d36f20f). 
* Once the Temperature Check has been completed, we will kick off the final governance vote next week.

# TL;DR

* Our vision is for Uniswap to be the liquidity layer of a self-sovereign Internet, a permissionless alternative to the gated, intermediary-owned exchanges of traditional finance. To get there, the UF is building and supporting **a robust ecosystem to grow, improve, and sustain the Uniswap Protocol for the long term.**
* Last year, Uniswap governance [approved](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/governance-proposal-create-the-uniswap-foundation/17499#fund-disbursements-12) the creation and initial funding of the Uniswap Foundation. Today we are requesting the remainder of our initial funding to support our next 2 years of work ($46.2M).
* We hosted a Twitter Spaces to discuss our RFC and answer questions on Monday, October 2 (link [here](https://twitter.com/UniswapFND/status/1708873305808044142)).
* In this post we’re also providing the community with:
  * A review of the UF’s progress over the last year: the team we have built, the grants we have disbursed and programs we’ve run, and their impact.
  * A look to the future: what is our vision for the UF, and what is coming next?
* We are kicking off our Temperature Check vote today, and will kick off our on-chain governance vote next week.

# UF Vision

Uniswap is critical infrastructure for a self-sovereign Internet, providing the liquidity layer for a flourishing world of tokens representing governance participation, community membership, the ability to participate in protocols, “real world” assets and more. It is critical financial infrastructure - providing a permissionless, credibly neutral alternative to the NYSE or SWIFT. It is an enabler of entrepreneurship, providing a liquidity platform for builders creating protocols and applications around the world.

We founded the Uniswap Foundation because we want to ensure that Uniswap is accessible for anyone in the world to leverage as permissionless financial and technological infrastructure for a long time.

How do we make that happen? **A robust, diverse, and values-aligned ecosystem.**

**A strong ecosystem is a competitive edge.** It expands a Protocol’s accessibility, increases its resiliency, and enables it to thrive in the face of ruthless competitive and market environments. It means more product and engineering talent driving the Protocol forward, into new markets with better user experience. It means values-aligned delegates who are able to thoughtfully weigh the tradeoffs of governance proposals. It means more serendipity, collaboration, and inspiration.

Looking across the crypto landscape it’s easy to see ecosystem strength as a competitive advantage. Ethereum is probably the best example. If Consensys and Ethereum’s earliest contributors were still the only teams building on and for Ethereum, it is easy to see a world where almost none of us would be here. Instead, Ethereum is one of the best places to build blockchain-based protocols and applications.

**The UF is building the Uniswap ecosystem.**

**How are we doing that exactly?**

**1. Growing core Protocol metrics, specifically driving net new order flow to strengthen the Protocol flywheel.**

* Over the next year, this looks like the development of a robust hooks development platform which broadens the pipeline of developers onto Uniswap and diversifies the kinds of things Uniswap is able to do.
* In the long term, this is 100ks+ of hook and application developers speaking to different use cases (crypto-native to RWA, building new financial primitives) and users globally, all while being able to generate a return for themselves.

**2. Building a pipeline for innovation on the Protocol, with the goal of enhancing the experience of swappers and LPs.**

 * Over the next year, this means launching the [TL;DR Fellowship](https://www.tldresear.ch/) and Conference, and creating working groups to apply cutting-edge research across MEV and other relevant areas directly to Uniswap.
 * In the long term, this means Uniswap is the default home for the world’s top crypto/DeFi researchers and academics to build POCs and iterate upon mechanisms to improve the experience of key DeFi stakeholders.

**3. Aligning incentives for stakeholders with long-term interests of the Protocol, turning Uniswap into a cockroach.**

 * Over the short term, this means two things: the development of realistic mechanisms to effectively capture Protocol value created and distribute it to stakeholders, and bringing stakeholders together to build trust and context IRL.
 * In the long term, this means the alignment of long-term interests of core stakeholder teams with the Protocol to weather future volatility and competition.

This approach will serve to increase Uniswap’s moat over time while ensuring it can adapt as tides change.

Below, we discuss what we’ve done so far, and how we plan to accomplish our goals in the future. Thank you for your support, as always. We wouldn’t be here without you. We’re grateful to have the opportunity to work with you in the coming years.

# Update: One Year In

Below, we provide a summary of what the UF Grants program and our team directly has accomplished over the last year.

## Grants

**Growth**

* Launch of [Oku Trade](https://oku.trade/) alongside Oku [API](https://oku.trade/api): a pro-trader interface accompanied by an API providing comprehensive real-time historical data across pools, swaps, positions, and more. [Oku Analytics](https://twitter.com/getty_hill/status/1702054215630078266), which will offer truly-real-time data across all chains it supports, will be launching soon.
  * Since launching in July, Oku Trade has had 3k unique wallet connections, and 56k unique site visitors.
  * Two projects, [Unispark](https://unispark.metacrypt.org/) and [UniChat](https://unichat.fn03.xyz/), have launched on top of the Oku API thus far.
  * Oku also plays a key role in Uniswap Protocol’s multi-chain expansion. By the end of the year they plan to support 10 chains. This includes chains like Boba and Moonbeam which otherwise would not have interface support.
* Partnership with [Gauntlet](https://twitter.com/gauntlet_xyz): UF’s year-long engagement with Gauntlet is focused on R&D into approaches to optimize incentive programs and fee design. We highlight some of their most interesting work [here](https://twitter.com/UniswapFND/status/1703837131163197479). They are building a Dynamic Incentive Optimization engine for community use to be released later this year.
* Hackathon sponsorship: We’ve partnered with ETHGlobal, Binance, and Arrakis to sponsor 3 hackathons (and 1 Hookathon) which have brought 150+ new projects and 200+ new developers into the ecosystem.
* Launch of the [Developer Ambassadors Program](https://uniswapfoundation.mirror.xyz/CfBq3TFcJG638hySx0ttu_HRDcNS7BMkQ2oQ0JrXqII): Our Ambassadors have started a [podcast](https://twitter.com/adamtj_eth/status/1683579698192826368) and deployed [UniChat](https://twitter.com/aiden0x4/status/1676992842152177664), a tool which leverages the Oku API and OpenAI to allow users to search Uniswap data using plain text.
* Enhancements to Uniswap v3 SDK - [Koray](https://twitter.com/koraykoska) and Florian are enhancing the SDK for a broader swath of developers and use cases, and making the code for liquidity management easier to use. They are on track to finish their work in November 2023.
* Support for new tools and research for Liquidity Providers, including the development of [Chaos Labs Strategy Simulator](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/uniswap/lp-strategy-calculator) and the [Messari LP Portal](https://messari.io/data-apps/uniswap-v3-lp-tool), as well as research on Advanced LP Strategies for Uniswap v3 conducted by [Atis Elsts](https://atise.medium.com/liquidity-provider-strategies-for-uniswap-v3-table-of-contents-64725c6c0b10) and [Vasily Tolstikov](https://medium.com/@med456789d).
* [Uniswap v3 Development Course](https://uniswapv3book.com/): a free, open-source Uniswap v3 Development Course that serves as a fundamental guide for developers, attracting 12,000 monthly visitors..

**Innovation**

* Launch of [TL;DR Research Institute](https://www.tldresear.ch/): a first of its kind DeFi-focused Research Institute led by a council of Defi’s leading researchers. The Institute will fund grants to and provide mentorship for fellows studying MEV, mechanism design, ZK, and more, and result in a DeFi Research Conference in the Spring. For its first fellowship, starting in October 2023, TL;DR received 107 applications from around the world.
* Industry-leading research on [Cross-chain MEV](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04159) -- which has led in turn to a specification for a [Proof of Concept (POC) MEV protection hook](https://ethresear.ch/t/lvr-minimization-in-uniswap-v4/15900)
* Novel research and implementations across a number of areas, including [Lanturn](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1338.pdf) (Measuring Economic Security of Smart Contracts through Adaptive Learning), [Chaos Labs TWAP Market Risk application](https://chaoslabs.xyz/posts/chaos-labs-uniswap-v3-twap-market-risk), [Axiom’s Checkpoint-free TWAP oracles](https://www.axiom.xyz/blog/uniswap), and research on [Pricing Nontoxic Orderflow](https://mirror.xyz/xenophonlabs.eth/EmgwRVmCc8Utvu6DmacS7dVGSl8ufkCss644z31z87I).

**Governance & Community**

* [Uniswap Agora](https://vote.uniswapfoundation.org/) and the Uniswap Delegate Race - [over 65 new delegates](https://twitter.com/UniswapFND/status/1665052818934251520) made new profiles (to compare, only 35 delegates have posted statement to the governance forum in the last 3 years)
* [Uniswap Cross-chain Bridge Report](https://uniswap.notion.site/Bridge-Assessment-Report-0c8477afadce425abac9c0bd175ca382) - A team of 8 produced a comprehensive analysis into the cross-chain requirements for Uniswap’s cross-chain governance use case, and an accompanying assessment of 9 bridges.

Below I want to summarize some of the work our team has done outside of grants:

**Growth & Innovation**

* Interviews with dozens of builders within the Uniswap ecosystem to develop a strategy to create and support a strong Hooks ecosystem for v4. Thus far we’ve also kicked off and are moderating an active Hook Dojo Telegram chat for 150+ hook developers, have hosted a [Hookathon](https://twitter.com/UniswapFND/status/1683983199872122881) at ETHcc, [Tacklebox Talks](https://twitter.com/devinawalsh/status/1705627482815148183) at ETHNYC, and are building v4 [documentation](https://docs.uniswapfoundation.org/hooks/dev-resources), with the community’s support.
* Building the [TL;DR Research Council](https://www.tldresear.ch/), and designing the Fellowship based on their unique insights. Over the coming months, our team will coordinate and run the first TL;DR Conference.
* Our team has coordinated and ran multiple hackathons, providing hands-on support to 100s of hackers.

**Governance**

* Organizing the Delegate Race with Agora and our first [Blessing](https://twitter.com/eek637/status/1705328971892539575), a governance-focused event for delegates to build knowledge, context, and community.
* Assist in the governance process from writing forum posts, to educating delegates and rallying votes, to writing the code, sometimes debugging the code, and validating the proposal outcome.
* In our original proposal, we [requested](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/governance-proposal-create-the-uniswap-foundation/17499#governance-participation-13) that Uniswap Governance delegate 2.5M UNI to the UF so that we could re-delegate to community members without enough UNI to submit a governance proposal. Since then we have delegated UNI to several individuals (or used it ourselves) to post the following proposals:

1. [Bharat.eth](https://twitter.com/bharat_eth), [Fix the Cross Chain Messaging Bridge on Arbitrum](https://vote.uniswapfoundation.org/proposals/29)
2. [0XPlasma.eth](https://twitter.com/0xPlasma), [Deploy Uniswap V3 on BNB Chain](https://vote.uniswapfoundation.org/proposals/31)
3. [Jack Melnick](https://twitter.com/jackmelnick_), [Deploy Uniswap V3 on Polygon zkEVM](https://vote.uniswapfoundation.org/proposals/34)
4. [Eek637.eth](https://twitter.com/eek637), [Create v3deployments.uniswap.eth subdomain and populate its text fields](https://vote.uniswapfoundation.org/proposals/38)
5. [GFXLabs.eth](https://twitter.com/labsGFX), [Deploy Uniswap V3 on Linea](https://vote.uniswapfoundation.org/proposals/42)
6. [Jesse Sawa](https://twitter.com/0xSawa), [Migrate the Celo Uniswap V3 Factory Contract owner from Optics to Wormhole](https://vote.uniswapfoundation.org/proposals/43)

**Regulatory**

* The Uniswap Foundation submitted a [comment letter](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-02-22/s70222-204419-411303.pdf) to the SEC’s proposed amendments to Exchange Act 3b-16.

# Looking ahead

We will continue to take a targeted approach to growing the Uniswap ecosystem, investing our capital and resources to fund and support projects and teams who will drive growth and strengthening of the ecosystem.

Below we cover several initiatives currently in flight, and upcoming over the next few months.

**Through the end of 2023, we plan to:**

* **Develop the Hooks ecosystem.** We’ll award grants to multiple teams to build a v4 SDK, develop hook best practices, educational resources, security standards, and libraries. We will fund high leverage hooks, including MEV mitigation hooks and hooks which increase LP profitability and experience. We’re also looking to accelerate the hook discovery and routing stack; create a hook launch playbook, and more. (Some of these grants may come in 2024). We’re also sponsoring more hackathons with hooks-related educational events for ETH Istanbul/Devconnect.
* **Launch the TL;DR Fellowship in October 2023.**
* **Continue IRL Delegate events and build more digital ways to connect.** We will host a second Blessing event at ETH Istanbul/Devconnect, and are working towards creating more ways for delegates to connect and educate themselves.
* Lay the groundwork for some of the big programs we’re excited to launch in 2024.

**Into 2024 and beyond, we want to offer insight into how we’re thinking about achieving our big goals.**

1. **In the realm of growth, we’re building an ecosystem of 100ks+ of hook and application developers speaking to different use cases and users globally.** This includes:

*  **Driving adoption of v4 as we continue to build the hooks platform.** Supporting liquidity migration to v4, the addition of net new liquidity and volume through novel hook development, continuing to fund hook developer content and tooling, and sponsor hookathons.
* **Broadening our pipeline of contributing teams through partnerships and multi-milestone grants with industry-leading organizations.** This might include curriculum development and hackathons to upskill new devs, or web3 onboarding for web2 engineers.
 * **Expanding our grantee support system** through more dedicated grantee relationship management and marketing support.
 * **Creating a studio** to incubate early founders building novel interfaces and applications.

2. **In the realm of innovation, we’re building a pipeline for the world’s top crypto/DeFi researchers to build POCs and iterate upon mechanisms to improve the experience of key DeFi stakeholders on Uniswap.**

* **Launching the TL;DR Conference in Q2 2024** and continuing to support the Institute’s growth.
*  **Building working groups of researchers and engineers** to ideate upon and build novel POCs to mitigate some of the protocol’s most pressing challenges and expand the protocol surface area, for instance redistribution of MEV profits and on-chain RFQ systems.

3. **In the realm of governance, we’re working towards an alignment of interests between stakeholders and the Protocol, turning Uniswap into a cockroach.**

* **Continuing to support digital and IRL governance platforms** and events to support delegates in building community and context.
 * **Supporting initiatives to create and distribute Protocol value to stakeholders** with community-led teams designing and implementing new ways to accrue and capture value for the Protocol, as well as mechanisms for value distribution.

# Request Breakdown

We are requesting **$46.2M** in funds today.

This funding will last provide the UF with 2 years of runway. In total, $28.33M will go towards grants, and $13.6M ($11.4M and 508k UNI) will be spent on operations over this timeframe. We have added a 10% buffer to mitigate price volatility. On the day we post the governance proposal, we will request our funds in UNI, using 30-day-TWAP to convert our request.

# Financials

## Historical

Grants

* Over the last year, the UF awarded $4.8M in grants across 5 categories, with the majority of grants being awarded to the Protocol Growth and R&D categories. We awarded our largest grant of $1.6M, to Oku Trade & API, shortly after UF launch. In our most recent quarter, we slowed down grant-making after the Uniswap v4 announcement. We shifted focus from making grants to Uniswap v3-focused projects to building our GTM and funding strategy for v4.
* Note that in addition to the $4.8M in grants commitments by the UF, the UF also inherited $886k of active UGP grants, which the UF disbursed over the last year. Total grants commitments including both UF and UGP grants totaled ~$5.7M.

![|662x211](upload://1oEyyVmt3a42jrVKMSbCjweIa83.png)

![|665x67](upload://r5eNzpGRt4CQJ84q9g7tDe1ubfV.png)

**Operations**

* Over the last year, we spent $3.15M on operations. This is on target with the [$3.24M we predicted](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-create-the-uniswap-foundation/17358#budget-11) we would require for our first year of Operations in our initial proposal, with the following caveats:
  * We note that the $289K cost of the [Uniswap Cross-chain Bridge Assessment Process](https://uniswapfoundation.mirror.xyz/RM7VRw1TLrZPio0G7QgiS2q-kooo8D65zNihK_2NlDc), the outputs of which were published to the public, was covered by our Ops budget due to the urgent nature of this work in Q1 and Q2 2023.
  * Our first employees hit their cliffs for UNI vesting in July. We disburse vesting on a quarterly basis, so the first disbursement will occur on October 1st.
* Our largest expenses were Payroll and Legal costs. Over the last year our Legal fees included costs to setup and receive our 501(c)(4) status; costs of defense in the [Risley class action lawsuit](https://decrypt.co/154312/uniswap-lawsuit-dismissed-defi-crypto-exchange-not-liable-for-scam-tokens); advisory work for team on how to effectively operate in an unstable regulatory environment; and advisory work to guide the UF’s work in supporting the Uniswap community, for example in our work to provide education and guidance related to the protocol fee switch.

![|650x183](upload://kMLQZaFwxU4FhcIkm1Q8PCRoQ4Y.png)

## Forecast

**Grants**

With the addition of funds, the UF will have **$30M** outstanding in grants capital remaining to disburse.

* We plan to disburse $10-$15M per year, with the amount disbursed per year increasing over time. We note that we are allocating a portion of the Innovation budget (up to $9M) towards designing and testing novel incentive mechanisms. We note this because it’s likely these funds will be disbursed all at once in an MVP of a program.
* We’ve recalibrated our grants categories and allocation budgets to focus on Grantee stakeholder groups.

![|616x197](upload://wZfSIeEtlojEzJDqiqfNESYo2IL.png)

**Projected Team Growth**

Over the next year, we plan to grow our Growth & Research, Grants, and Technology teams in order to realize our goals. Specifically, we plan to:

* Hire 2 individuals in Growth & Research to support our ongoing efforts, and to grow our expertise in the R&D efforts we are funding.
* Hire 2 individuals on our Grants Team, including a Grants Lead.
* Hire 2 individuals on our Technology team, one to support ongoing Product development grants and one to support Developer Relations.
* Hire an Executive Assistant to support our teams’ internal operations.
* In FY2025, we anticipate hiring up to 2 additional team members.

![|343x143](upload://1HSkSiBPrvoiLarjrnHLYC9Ooqk.png)

**Operations**

* For the next two years, including funds on hand, we will have $13.6M and 961,364 UNI remaining to spend on Ops moving forward ($17.9M total at current UNI prices) through Q4 2025.
* Because we are now planning for the next 2 years, we are adding an additional $1M in buffer to cover unexpected legal costs.

![|574x235](upload://dOqJItUB64K8G2WmaQrTstMwMj6.png)

**Additional Notes**

Over the last year, the UF has spent $3.15M on ops and $5.4M in grants. We offer a few comments on these amounts below:

* Over the last quarter, we slowed down grant-making activities purposefully in order to build a strategy for grant-making for v4. We expect grants to double or triple to $10-$15M in grants committed per year. Over the next year, our annual operational spend is projected to increase by only ~20%. Over time as we scale we expect the ratio of grants-to-ops spend to continue to increase.
* That being said we also want to note the multitude of activities that our team takes on outside of vanilla grant-making. Many of our team members spend their time incubating and coordinating novel grant-making programs, like the TL;DR Research Institute. And, approximately 50% of our teams’ time over the last year was focused outside of grant-making, including on event/hackathon coordination, hands-on support, marketing & comms, and legal/regulatory work.

The UF will retain the need to receive governance approval via an off-chain vote for grants larger than $2M. For that vote, we will use the terms set for the Temperature Check -- a 5-day Snapshot poll with 10M quorum.

**Tranche 1 Review**

Last year in our Tranche 1 of funding, we requested 2,547,002 UNI with the goal of receiving $20M. However the price of UNI decreased over the 11 days between our request and when it hit our wallet, decreasing the UNI’s value to $17.3M.

* We priced this at the 30-day TWAP of $8.14 on the day we kicked off the governance vote August 17 2022. At this price, 2,547,002 UNI equates to $20M.
* When we received the funds on August 25, the UNI price had fallen 13.7% to $7.05, meaning that $17.3M worth of UNI hit our multi-sig. We use this number, $17.3M, to calculate the remainder of capital owed to the UF.

## Treasury Diversification

Our Treasury Diversification policy is designed to prioritize capital preservation and risk mitigation. We also maintain a portion of our assets in UNI to offer as part of a compensation package to our employees, to align interests with that of the Uniswap ecosystem.

Funds will be split between Operations and Grants. Below we detail our methodology for diversifying our assets within these two categories.

For Operational funds, we will:

1. Set aside UNI tokens to be used in employee compensation packages.
2. Maintain 6 months runway in cash in an FDIC-insured bank account.
3. Invest the remainder of our funds in a low-risk yield bearing asset.

For Grants funds, we will:

1. Maintain a portion of funds in stablecoins.
2. Maintain 6 months of anticipated grants funding in an FDIC-insured bank account.
3. Invest the remainder of our funds in a low-risk yield bearing asset.

This plan aligns our financial strategy with our core objectives, minimizing risk from market volatility to safeguard the foundation’s operations and grant-making commitments.

After a successful temperature check as well as deployments of Uniswap
V3 on both our Alpha and Sepolia testnets, Scroll looks to move towards a final
governance proposal to officially approve Scroll’s Uniswap V3 deployment on its newly
launched mainnet.

The [temperature check](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0xc874c15656ac985df2f34d4438f8d074226f10408dd74f08295227974179b2c1) passed with 28M (100%) YES votes in August.

**Point of Contact:** \[Shahryar Hasnani, E-mail: shahryar@scroll.io]

## **Proposal Overview**

We propose that the Uniswap DAO recognizes Scroll’s mainnet deployment of Uniswap
V3 as the official - canonical deployment. Uniswap V3 has already been deployed and
highly utilized on Scroll’s Alpha and Sepolia testnets, with the router contract having
processed over 1.8M and 450K transactions on each testnet, respectively. A brief
overview of Scroll:

* Scroll is a bytecode-compatible zk-rollup, a native zkEVM scaling solution for Ethereum.
* Scroll is an open-source project developed in collaboration with the Ethereum Foundation Privacy and Scaling Explorations organization. It was built [with the community, for the community.](https://github.com/scroll-tech)
* [Our community ethos and vision](https://scroll.io/story) are aligned with Ethereum. We are committed to a secure, decentralized, censorship-resistant, and efficient future that Ethereum offers through our plans to decentralize Scroll sequencers and provers.

## **Motivation**

We believe that Uniswap being deployed on multiple Ethereum L2s is integral for encouraging competition and diversity of technical solutions to scale Ethereum. Furthermore, we believe that Uniswap’s community and the ecosystem that Scroll strives for are closely aligned. Both projects are building trustless, decentralized, and secure financial infrastructure that is accessible to anyone, regardless of merit or location. Deploying to Scroll offers many benefits, including significant user savings, an expanded user base, capturing the zkEVM market, and fostering L2 native innovation. The endgame of Ethereum and its L2s will be fundamentally underpinned by ZK— this deployment puts Uniswap in the best position to capitalize on the future of the EVM ecosystem by integrating with the most Ethereum-aligned and future-proof L2. Uniswap on Scroll will integrate closely with Scroll’s rapidly growing ecosystem. Dozens of projects have committed to deploying on our mainnet, and over 150 have deployed on our testnets, including AAVE, Lens, the Graph, Covalent, Safe, and Etherscan to name a few. Given the excitement around Scroll and current usage of our testnet, we expect hundreds of projects to deploy on our mainnet post-launch. Importantly, Uniswap on Scroll will propel L2 DEX innovation. We are on the brink of uncovering L2 native use cases that have not been feasible on Ethereum L1. Scroll will bring new developers and ecosystem integrations to Uniswap.

## **Partner Details**

**Scroll**

This proposal and the deployment of Uniswap contracts will be performed by the Scroll
Foundation, a foundation registered in the Republic of Seychelles.

**Delegate Sponsor**

In addition, Scroll is working with the [Michigan Blockchain](https://twitter.com/UMichBlockchain), which will act as the
delegate sponsor for this proposal.

* ***Proposers:*** Scroll Foundation
* ***Proposal Sponsor:*** Michigan Blockchain
* ***Deployer:*** Scroll Foundation
* ***Bridge Provider:*** Scroll Native Bridge

**Conflict of Interest Declaration**

There are no existing financial or contractual relationships between Scroll and any of Uniswap’s legal entities, including Uniswap Labs, UNI DAO & Foundation, nor investments of Uniswap Labs Ventures.

## **Additional information for cross-chain deployments**

Our focus has always been on providing the best possible experience for developers, and we have successfully delivered on this promise on our testnet, which we will continue to do on mainnet. We are proud to say that we are bytecode-compatible, meaning that migrating dapps from any EVM chain is easy and hassle-free.

**EVM-equivalent:** Scroll uses a forked version of Geth, enabling seamless infrastructure migration. Any application can be migrated to Scroll without code changes and additional audits.

**Developer friendly:** Scroll will support all existing development tools, including debuggers. Developers can work with a familiar development environment. No bytecode re-audits will be required minimizing the risk surface tremendously.

**Security:** Scroll inherits most of EVM’s features and security, which is by far the most battle-tested smart contract infrastructure in the entire space.

**Decentralization:** Scroll is leading the way in developing a decentralized prover network and has already committed to outsourcing proving. By decentralizing proof generation to the community, Scroll can achieve efficient proof generation and establish a more robust ecosystem.

We have always been committed to building in the open, starting from our collaboration with EF’s PSE team, and we remain closely connected to the Ethereum community—in fact, our team has contributed [~50% of the upstream PSE zkEVM codebase over the past two years](https://twitter.com/pseudotheos/status/1664249089998077960). Furthermore, we have been open source from day 1, have a strong in- house security team paired with rigorous audits, and are aiming to have third-party provers upon our mainnet genesis block and a gradual decentralization of our sequencer network.

The Scroll community has been testing the Uniswap V3 deployment on [Scroll’s testnets](https://sepolia-blockscout.scroll.io/) for months, often exceeding 200,000 transactions per day - more than many other L2s. In fact, our testnet community has successfully processed over 1.8M transactions through the Uniswap V3 router on our Alpha Testnet over 450k transactions on our Sepolia Testnet already.

## Protocol Security

ZK-Rollups are currently the most secure Layer 2 scaling solution. On the premise of inheriting the security of Ethereum, it relies exclusively on cryptography rather than unreliable crypto-economics.

Scroll has a trustless Layer 1 <> Layer 2 canonical bridge, which supports arbitrary message delivery. The bridge is part of the roll-up mechanism, verified by the smart contract and the zkEVM, which is much more secure than relayer-based bridges.

Security is the first priority for us. Scroll implements the EVM, which is well-specified and battle-tested, as well as the well-established and researched Halo2 cryptographic library. [Additionally, we have zkEVM circuit audits from Trail of Bits, Zellic, and KALOS; Bridge and rollup contracts audits from OpenZeppelin and Zellic; and Node implementation audits from Trail of Bits. We also have a bug bounty on ImmuneFi with a maximum reward of $1M.](https://scroll.io/blog/scrolls-security-measures) And finally, we have an in-house security team that continuously reviews our codebase.

We are launching with a timelock delay for contract and admin upgrades, and soon plan to establish a security council to control privileged functions and contract upgrades.

Finally, in a continuous process after mainnet launch, we will be working on developing decentralized sequencers and provers in an effort to secure and reduce the trust assumptions of using the network.

## **Success Criteria**

Deployment of Uniswap on Scroll will:

* Increase Uniswap TVL
* Grow Uniswap order volume
* Enable listing of new assets on Uniswap that are unique to Scroll
* Allow Uniswap to benefit from exposure to cutting-edge ZK technology and applications on Scroll (e.g., potential new functionality, projects to provide grants to, etc.)

The best way to measure success for Uniswap on Scroll is to focus on TVL and transaction volumes; however, there are a variety of other benefits Scroll will bring, such as onboarding its dedicated and expanding developer community to Uniswap, thereby boosting the growth of Uniswap’s developer community—this is also a critical success criteria.

## Deployment Details

The approval of this proposal by Uniswap governance will lead the stated Uniswap v3 contracts to be deemed as the canonical deployment on Scroll. As is the case with all canonical v3 deployments, this deployment will be subject to Ethereum Layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control.

## Timeline

The temperature check has passed, and the relevant Uniswap v3 contracts have been deployed on Scroll. If the onchain vote passes, this deployment will be officially recognized as a canonical v3 deployment through an amendment to the v3deployments.uniswap.eth subdomain."

**Summary**
Despite being one of the most prominent DeFi protocols, Uniswap’s outstanding voting power does not necessarily translate into active governance participation. In fact, many top delegates with considerable voting power have less than 50% vote participation rate, and some even as low as 10% or 0%. While there have been previous [campaigns ](https://x.com/UniswapFND/status/1653077861706739714?s=20)to encourage delegation by large UNI holders, we have seen that further delegate accountability is needed as many of those who received large delegations barely participated, if at all.

In healthy governance environments, proactive delegates wield significant voting power, ensuring malicious votes are prevented and quorum requirements are met. Therefore, this proposal requests the Uniswap Foundation delegate in total 10 million UNI to 7 active yet underrepresented delegates. To ensure further accountability, each delegate must maintain a 80% participation rate at a minimum (as explained further in Participation Requirements) or is subject to undelegation via the Franchiser contract explained below. In addition, there will be a 1 year term so the community can revisit for improvements and lessons learned. And if a received delegate is removed without filling this 1 year term, the role won’t be filled.

**Landscape of Uniswap Governance**

Despite numerous improvements to Uniswap’s governance, there are still several areas that require further improvement. One prominent area is governance participation, which has witnessed a downward trend compared to late 2022 and early 2023.

Another issue is many large delegates are now inactive, and the delegators who entrusted them with delegation are either unaware about this inactivity or simply do not care. For example, there is currently several delegates with more than 2.5 million UNI delegated who never even voted onchain according to Tally, see the screenshot below.

Therefore, further distributing governance power to active but underrepresented delegates is a positive step forward ensuring governance is more active, resilient, and robust.

**Proposal History**

The Temperature Check regarding “Delegation of UNI to Active but Underrepresented Delegates” has [passed](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0x14aa7becb547ccb8fdcfc69054bda1557a90f1ebe3ac45569f049b5e29e98d76), and there was a 5-day period where delegates that met the application criteria posted their application to be considered for delegation. There were 7 qualified delegates, and there was a forum poll to decide on the UNI delegation distribution method, where a majority of qualified delegates voted for “Top 4 Delegates will get delegation till 2.5 M is achieved. The rest of UNI (out of 10 M) will be split among the rest proportional to their votes won.” Then the [Snapshot poll](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0x73753f8ccab7747563b9c17a0bc746e6207991561278d7cadfaa1a7be12b081a**) to determine such distribution amount was launched.

To ensure further accountability, each delegate must maintain a 80% participation rate at a minimum or is subject to undelegation via the Franchiser contract explained below. In addition, there will 1 year term when UNI from this initiative is delegated. so the community can revisit for improvements and lessons learned. And if a received delegate is removed without filling this 1 year term, the role won’t be filled.

To further clarify, each delegate must vote on 80% (or more) of proposals (minus the proposals that were canceled) over the last 3 months continuously. This includes both Snapshot and Onchain proposals (such as Tally or Agora).

**Technical Implementation**

In terms of technical implementation, as Erin Koen has suggested, “it will be one function call on the FranchiserFactory contract [here ](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf754A7E347F81cFdc70AF9FbCCe9Df3D826360FA). The Timelock will call the [`fundMany`](https://github.com/NoahZinsmeister/franchiser/blob/962079a092f4db1142473658e1650855831886c5/src/FranchiserFactory.sol#L77) function, and pass it two arrays of calldata. The first will be `[delegatees]` and the second will be `[amounts]`. The address at index 0 of the `delegatee` array receives the amount of votes at index 0 of the `amounts` array. The result of that function call will be an individual [`Franchiser`](https://github.com/NoahZinsmeister/franchiser/blob/main/src/Franchiser.sol) contract deployed for each delegate funded by the amount of tokens defined”

“The Timelock will be the `owner` of all Franchiser contracts deployed from this vote, and can recall the tokens by calling the `recall` function (via a subsequent on-chain vote) on each contract at any time.”

This delegation would severely help my work on the Deployment Accountability Committee as often the question of how to submit an ecosystem’s Uniswap deployment on-chain is posed. Of course, with >2.5m delegation, we can easily propose and skip that burdensome step.

## **Summary**

Despite being one of the most prominent DeFi protocols, Uniswap’s outstanding voting power does not necessarily translate into active governance participation. In fact, many top delegates with considerable voting power have less than 50% vote participation rate, and some even as low as 10% or 0%. While there have been previous [campaigns ](https://x.com/UniswapFND/status/1653077861706739714?s=20)to encourage delegation by large UNI holders, we have seen that further delegate accountability is needed as many of those who received large delegations barely participated, if at all.

In healthy governance environments, proactive delegates wield significant voting power, ensuring malicious votes are prevented and quorum requirements are met. Therefore, this proposal requests the Uniswap Foundation delegate in total 10 million UNI to 7 active yet underrepresented delegates. To ensure further accountability, each delegate must maintain a 80% participation rate at a minimum (as explained further in Participation Requirements) or is subject to undelegation via the Franchiser contract explained below. In addition, there will be a 1 year term so the community can revisit for improvements and lessons learned. And if a received delegate is removed without filling this 1 year term, the role won’t be filled.

Despite numerous improvements to Uniswap’s governance, there are still several areas that require further improvement. One prominent area is governance participation, which has witnessed a downward trend compared to late 2022 and early 2023.

Another issue is many large delegates are now inactive, and the delegators who entrusted them with delegation are either unaware about this inactivity or simply do not care. For example, there is currently several delegates with more than 2.5 million UNI delegated who never even voted onchain according to Tally, see the screenshot below.

Therefore, further distributing governance power to active but underrepresented delegates is a positive step forward ensuring governance is more active, resilient, and robust.

## **Proposal History**

The Temperature Check regarding “Delegation of UNI to Active but Underrepresented Delegates” has [passed](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0x14aa7becb547ccb8fdcfc69054bda1557a90f1ebe3ac45569f049b5e29e98d76), and there was a 5-day period where delegates that met the application criteria posted their application to be considered for delegation. There were 7 qualified delegates, and there was a forum poll to decide on the UNI delegation distribution method, where a majority of qualified delegates voted for “Top 4 Delegates will get delegation till 2.5 M is achieved. The rest of UNI (out of 10 M) will be split among the rest proportional to their votes won.” Then the [Snapshot poll](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0x73753f8ccab7747563b9c17a0bc746e6207991561278d7cadfaa1a7be12b081a**) to determine such distribution amount was launched.

NOTE: PGov is proposing as one address can only submit one vote at a time

# Summary

We are proposing to lower the current proposal threshold (PT) from 2.5M UNI to 1M UNI with the intention of broadening the delegate base capable of submitting onchain proposals, thereby increasing delegate engagement. This request aligns with the increasing maturity and expanding influence of the Uniswap protocol.

# Terminology

Proposal threshold and voting quorum are two vital parameters for ensuring that a DAO is functioning properly.

* The quorum dictates how much friction is required to pass a proposal. This parameter conveys the *minimum number of votes required for a proposal to pass*. Quorum should NOT be easy to reach and ideally requires the participation of numerous large delegates. A high enough quorum ensures that malicious and/or ineffectual proposals do not pass. **Uniswap’s current quorum is 40M UNI. The quorum is a gauge for how difficult it is to pass a proposal.**
* The PT serves a similar purpose to the quorum parameter. This number conveys the *minimum amount of $UNI that a delegate must hold in order to create a proposal onchain.* **Uniswap’s current proposal threshold is 2.5M UNI.** The friction point here is that a wallet must either purchase or be delegated enough governance tokens to reach this threshold, otherwise, they cannot put a vote onchain. A high PT prevents a DAO from freely posting proposals, subjecting it to centralization risk, while a low PT can lead to vote spamming. **The PT is a gauge for determining how freely people are allowed to create proposals.**

It’s important to put quorum and PT in the context of the governance token’s circulating and total supply, allowing us to normalize parameters across multiple DAOs.

* **Circulating Supply (CS):** The total number of tokens currently available and active in the market, excluding those held in reserve or otherwise not in circulation. **Uniswap’s current CS is ~754M UNI.**
* **Total Supply (TS):** The complete count of tokens created, including those in circulation, held in reserve, or locked for various purposes, representing the maximum potential supply. **Uniswap’s TS is 1B UNI.**

# Motivation

At inception, Uniswap DAO’s governance framework required that “[1% of all UNI must be cast in favor to submit a proposal, and 4% in order to pass a vote.](https://docs.uniswap.org/concepts/governance/guide-to-voting)” In terms of tokens, this meant that the proposal threshold was 10M UNI, and the quorum was 40M UNI. These percentages use the *total supply* of UNI (1B), not the *circulating supply*, as the denominator. Acknowledging the restrictive nature of this parameter, the proposal threshold was quickly [reduced from 10M UNI to 2.5M UNI](https://boardroom.io/uniswap/proposal/cHJvcG9zYWw6dW5pc3dhcDphcmNoaXZlOjQ=). This alteration took place **over two years ago**.

Since then, we have seen Uniswap governance mature and onboard new delegates. And of the current delegate cohort, ~33 have the ability to post onchain proposals. Unfortunately, many of the entities with enough voting power are scarcely involved in DAO forums and votes. Lowering the PT will help reduce the proposal creation barrier for delegates who are actually active in the DAO. This, in concert with [recent initiatives to increase active delegates’ voting power](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-delegation-of-uni-to-active-but-underrepresented-delegates/22238), will aid in further decentralizing Uniswap decision making.

# Rationale for Reducing the PT to 1M UNI

### **New DAOs Require High Thresholds**

Most DAOs set decentralization as a north star metric that’s achieved over time. Initially, protocols tend to start out more centralized, and their governance parameters are indicative of their degree of maturity. A less mature protocol should start off with a high PT, for example. Core contributors and a circle of trusted entities should primarily be involved in proposal creation to ensure that the protocol grows legs. At this time, the token value tends to be lower as well, along with a relatively insignificant treasury. Therefore, the respective PT and quorum should be high enough to prevent nefarious actors from depleting reserves and collapsing the protocol before it reaches any sort of prominence. Responsibilities and workloads should, however, become dispersed across more and more contributors as the protocol grows.

### **As a Protocol Grows, the PT Economic Cost Also Increases**

A growing protocol typically correlates with an increasing token price. So, the economic cost of creating proposals and reaching quorum simultaneously increases. This means that the DAO must over time reduce such parameters. When Uniswap lowered its PT to 2.5M, the economic cost of putting a vote onchain was still upwards of $50M. At that time, the UNI token was less than a year old, and governance was extremely nascent, so caution remained the best policy.

In the past year, the UNI token went as low as ~$3.50. With a PT of 2.5M, the economic cost of putting a vote onchain hit ~$8.75M. And yet, the DAO wasn’t spammed with votes. It’s therefore clear that we should not be worried about an influx of useless proposals upon a reduction of the PT. Plus, as Uniswap v4, X, and perhaps a fee switch are introduced, along with a turn in economic conditions, the token value will likely increase. Hence, a reduction of the PT seems to be inevitable. It’s a matter of when–not if.

### **If You Have 1M UNI, You Are Likely a Trusted Actor**

We are proposing to reduce the PT to 1M UNI. That is in and of itself not an insignificant amount. If an entity is able to purchase that much UNI or attain an equivalent amount via delegation, it’s likely that they are a trusted and competent party. Okay, perhaps that’s too optimistic. *So let’s ask–if the entity is nefarious, what’s the worst that can happen?* Answer: you get a bad proposal that never reaches quorum. If a nefarious proposal does reach quorum, we’ve got other problems. But it’s unlikely due to the massive capital requirement.

**At the end of the day, Uniswap’s 40M quorum is enough to prevent malice, regardless of how low the PT is.** Again, the quorum is a gauge for how difficult it is to pass a proposal, and the PT is a gauge for determining how freely people are allowed to create proposals. **Suppressing the latter is counterproductive to growing and decentralizing the DAO.**

### **We Should Increases the DAO’s Autonomy**

As of today, ~33 delegates are able to cross the 2.5M PT. Decreasing the PT to 1M increases that number to ~47 (again, with a small margin of error). This is effectively a centralization choke point, where proposers must turn to a select few delegates who may or may not be in support of sponsoring a proposal.

*The above table shows the number of proposals created by delegates with large amounts of voting power today. This does not include proposals posted by wallets who received temporary delegation. “% vote” is participation in the past 10 onchain votes. Proposals posted is the number of proposals created onchain since the Governor Bravo upgrade (i.e. since Q3 2021).*

If the few delegates who have enough voting power are disinterested in a proposal, it may never go onchain, even if the proposal passes the temperature check phase. One option that proposers currently have is the ability to turn to the Uniswap Foundation, who can then delegate the proposer 2.5M UNI–however, that creates a reliance on the Foundation.

# Ethereum DAO Comparables

Comparing governance parameters and token ratios between DAOs is a tough exercise since most DAOs are not mature and have different objectives. The reality is that Uniswap sits in a position to set standards for other DAOs, and we certainly don’t have all of the answers, so the best that we can do is experiment. Regardless, below are some data illustrating where the Uniswap DAO sits compared to the industry.

*The* [forum post contains graphs](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-lower-onchain-proposal-threshold/22429) *comparing the Proposal Threshold (PT), Total Supply (TS), Circulating Supply (CS), and Quorum (Q) ratios of 7 DAOs on Ethereum.*

Uniswap currently has the highest Q/TS ratio, along with Compound, from the given sample. It’s also on the higher end when looking at Q/CS. This means that relative to other DAOs, it takes more votes to pass a proposal. **Since we are not proposing to lower the quorum, we can rest assured that the barrier for a vote to pass remains high enough to prevent security issues.**

The PT/TS and PT/CS ratios, however, are on average lower for Uniswap relative to the sample. **So, relatively speaking, proposal creation is already easier for Uniswap, and the PT reduction to 1M will make it even easier.** This may simply indicate that DAOs overall are too constrictive. But a relative comparison here doesn’t tell the whole story. Even though the PT/TS and PT/CS are lower for Uni DAO, the absolute dollar amount that it takes to post a proposal is by far still the highest for Uniswap. The below table shows that the PT in dollar terms is $15.6M, with Aave coming in second at $7.2M and Compound third with only $1.3M. **The dollar cost for creating a proposal on Uniswap is ~4.5 times higher when compared to the sample.**

# A New Model Going Forward

Today, the role of a delegate is pretty passive. All that’s required is voting yes, no, or abstain on proposals–unfortunately, many delegates don’t even fulfill that responsibility. Some delegates may take it a step further and contribute to discussions. And a select few with enough voting power may also create onchain proposals. The ability to post a vote onchain on behalf of another entity is currently a job that’s not given enough weight. Let’s categorize this relationship further.

**Delegate**: an entity with delegated voting power

**Proposer**: the entity that authors/initiates a proposal

**Sponsor**: the facilitator of the governance process, taking a proposal from early-stage to onchain execution. Delegates with enough voting power to meet the PT are considered sponsors

An ideal DAO ecosystem is one where we have a handful of entities with the ability to sponsor proposals. A rolodex of sponsors should enable proposers to pick and choose which sponsors to approach for facilitating the governance process. Ideally, the proposer seeks to team up with a sponsor who holds similar values so that both parties are motivated to see the proposal through. Sponsors can also help co-author proposals, depending on how involved they’d like to get. A variety of sponsors, each with their own biases and areas of focus, allows for healthy debate and diversity of opinion. The sponsors should therefore be stewards of the DAO and not merely wallets who happen to have a bunch of voting power. An interconnected system like this is also superior to simply asking the Uniswap Foundation for temporary delegation as it’s less communal than that of sponsor–proposer partnerships.

Beyond the collectivistic aspect, sponsors, if they so choose, can take their proposals from RFC to onchain vote independently. This autonomy is something that’s currently scarce, which may be a contributing factor behind a lack of development in DAOs.

Reducing the PT certainly helps lower friction in the mentioned areas, ideally leading to a more democratized and active Uniswap DAO.

| Protocol | Proposal Threshold | Total Supply     | Circulating Supply | Quorum        | PT/TS  | PT/CS  | PT/Q   | Q/TS   | Q/CS   |
| -------- | ------------------ | ---------------- | ------------------ | ------------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Uniswap  | 1,000,000.00       | 1,000,000,000.00 | 753,766,667.00     | 40,000,000.00 | 0.100% | 0.133% | 2.500% | 4.000% | 5.307% |

# **Proposal Motivation**

We [<u>Michigan Blockchain</u>](https://twitter.com/UMichBlockchain) are submitting this proposal to facilitate the integration of Uniswap V3 on Rootstock (RSK), the first Bitcoin sidechain. Rootstock combines the security of Bitcoin and the functionality of Ethereum. This amalgam is enabled by RSK’s implementation of a merged mining architecture and an EVM-compatible execution environment. Unlike most deployments during the bear market, RSK has doubled-down on this initiative, allocating a total of $3 million for bootstrapping liquidity across various pools.

What’s more is that the [<u>IOV Labs</u>](https://www.iovlabs.org/) team (the research and development group behind RSK) has been closely collaborating with both [<u>GFX Labs</u>](https://twitter.com/labsGFX) and [<u>Wormhole</u>](https://wormhole.com/) to ensure that this deployment is completed seamlessly. They have taken all of the necessary technical steps to be eligible for finalizing this deployment. The relevant v3 contracts are now deployed on RSK (see “Deployment Details”), along with pools for trading RBTC (1:1 with $BTC), RIF, and wETH, all accessible using the [<u>Oku Trade front-end</u>](https://oku.trade/app/rootstock/pool/0xd2ffe51ab4e622a411abbe634832a19d919e9c55?utm_source=uniswap\&utm_medium=forum\&utm_campaign=rootstocktemp). This deployment has already aggregated over [<u>$1.1M of TVL</u>](https://oku.trade/info/rootstock/overview?utm_source=uniswap\&utm_medium=forum\&utm_campaign=rootstocktemp) and is seeing[<u> upwards of $540k in daily volume</u>](https://oku.trade/info/rootstock/overview?utm_source=uniswap\&utm_medium=forum\&utm_campaign=rootstocktemp) over the past two weeks. Plus, the Wormhole integration is in place to facilitate any cross-chain governance messaging. The final hurdle is to officiate this proposal through the Uniswap governance process, and recognize this as the canonical v3 deployment on RSK.



### **Introducing Uniswap to the Bitcoin Space**

We’ve been in contact with IOV Labs for the past couple of months regarding this deployment. Our teams have had back and forth conversations regarding the merits and drawbacks of bringing Uniswap to a Bitcoin sidechain, which, admittedly, has limited mindshare among DeFi users across other EVM chains. Currently, there are two divergent user profiles when it comes to Bitcoin. The first is the staunch Bitcoin Maxi. This person views $BTC as the one and true cryptocurrency, with a notable preference for highly secure and isolated systems. Conversely, we have the DeFi users. Most of their activity takes place on the EVM, and their objective is financial gain using various onchain instruments–staking, liquidity provision, borrowing/lending, yield farming, perpetuals, etc. Security is important to everyone, at least idealistically speaking, but users’ actions often indicate a preference for profiteering in the face of taking a degree of risk.

However, we think that there may be a market in between these two that Uniswap–and DeFi protocols in general–could help service. It could very well be the case that users who want to conduct DeFi transactions using $BTC will do so through dapps launched on RSK. The security guarantees using the merged-mining setup make interacting with $BTC on RSK ($RBTC) more secure than using $BTC on alternative smart contract platforms. Although it may be a reaching assumption that users will have the motivation to prioritize security to such an extent, easy access to RSK via wallets like Metamask make it frictionless for users to jump between ETH and RSK. The potential concern here, however, is liquidity fragmentation. That is, unless, a certain market of users exclusively uses RSK for all things BTC.

# **A Primer on Rootstock**

### **Bringing the EVM to Bitcoin**

Launched in 2018, RSK is the first Bitcoin sidechain. Generally speaking, a sidechain is an independent blockchain that’s fettered to a parent blockchain. In this case, Bitcoin is the parent chain, while RSK is the sidechain. The sidechain extension typically features aspects that the primary chain cannot support–Ethereum folk are very familiar with functionality separation nowadays due to the multichain and modular nature of EVM-based systems. Bitcoin is naturally more isolated, with a particular focus on sustaining the so-to-speak sanctity of its chain. However, the bare bones nature of Bitcoin means that it cannot support complex applications due to limitations around programmability. So how can this system be improved? Well, Bitcoin itself ideally stays untouched. Its usage as a ledger for an incorruptible store of value is therefore preserved, but it can be complemented with a sidechain like RSK.

**RSK is an EVM-compatible Bitcoin sidechain**, meaning that it is Turing complete and enables developers to construct a robust ecosystem with close proximity to the Bitcoin blockchain. Specifically, the chain uses the [<u>RSK Virtual Machine (RVM)</u>](https://dev.rootstock.io/rsk/architecture/), which is compatible with the EVM at the op-code level. This is precisely why Uniswap, and alike Ethereum dapps, have the ability to seamlessly deploy on RSK without significant smart contract modifications. Core Ethereum infrastructure, wallets, and tooling (Hardhat, Truffle, Ether.js, Web3.js, etc) also support RSK–so devs can easily migrate to and build on RSK while a user can simply [<u>add RSK</u>](https://chainlist.org/chain/30) to their already running list of chains on Metamask. But a shared execution environment is not enough of a value add. That’s where we must consider RSK’s true value proposition: shared security with Bitcoin.



### **Security Before All Else–Merged Mining**

Unlike most other blockchains, RSK employs a consensus mechanism known as merged mining, allowing miners to simultaneously secure both Bitcoin and RSK at no extra cost. This results in RSK benefiting from the formidable security and stability touted by Bitcoin. Approximately[<u> 50% of the current Bitcoin hashrate is involved in securing RSK</u>](https://stats.rsk.co/). In other words, many of the same miners that provide security to Bitcoin are also securing RSK using the same hardware and energy inputs. Some of the largest Bitcoin mining pools like Antpool, Luxor, Braiins, F2Pool, and Binance Pool, have all opted into the merged mining setup.

**What about previous failures surrounding merged mining like CoiledCoin?**

* Rootstock doesn’t implement the traditional merge-mining mechanism used by CoiledCoin–but a more modern protocol with additional security guarantees. This is explained by RSK’s Chief Scientist [<u>here. </u>](https://medium.com/iovlabs-innovation-stories/modern-merge-mining-f294e45101a0)An in-depth analysis can be found in the Consensus section [<u>here</u>](https://medium.com/iovlabs-innovation-stories/measuring-rsk-security-d169ac03b181). The infamous CoiledCoin attack was performed by a single individual (LukeJr) who could control more than 51% of the blockchain hashrate, which is impossible on Rootstock, and was ideologically motivated because CoiledCoin competed with Bitcoin, something Rootstock does not do. On the contrary, Rootstock provides additional value to Bitcoin. Rootstock talks have been given at Bitcon [<u>conferences</u>](https://baltichoneybadger.com/) without opposition of any kind. The same individual that attacked CoiledCoin has a positive opinion regarding Rootstock and a neutral opinion on the sidechain’s hashrate escrows.



### **Two-way Proof of Work Peg (PoWPeg)**

Rootstock does not have its own token nor inflation-based incentives. The way Bitcoin and RSK are connected is via a two-way peg using $BTC. A user deposits their $BTC in the RSK bridge, which, in turn, mints the rBTC on the RSK network. Both assets will always have a 1:1 ratio, and the max amount of mintable rBTC is the same as the max BTC supply of 21M. Hence, the main asset that the entire RSK ecosystem relies on is, at the end of the day, $BTC. RSK mining rewards are paid out to miners solely through transaction fees in the form of $rBTC.

Typically, if a PoW chain relies solely on rewarding its miners with txn fees, and if that chain has low volume, it would be subject to a 51% attack. This issue, however, is subverted under a shared security system like merged mining. No matter how low the volume falls, the network will remain steady because the reliance is entirely on the security of Bitcoin. Sure, one could argue Bitcoin itself could face fragility if txn fees and incentives simultaneously become too low–however, it is an unlikely case since the adoption of $BTC is so pervasive that many large parties are incentivized to secure the system even if it’s at a capital loss. Plus, innovations like [<u>inscriptions continue to sustain momentum for Bitcoin’s usage</u>](https://messari.io/report/bitcoin-brief-runes-grayscale-and-microstrategy?referrer=research-reports).

# **Bitcoin Ecosystem Catalysts**

If we analyze the previous points about the robust security and EVM compatibility of RSK, it’s clear how there may be an untapped market here for Uniswap to enter. Bitcoin, relative to the rest of the crypto market, is to a degree, isolated. The adoption of Bitcoin has been far more prominent around the world relative to other cryptocurrencies, even becoming [<u>legal tender in countries like El Salvador</u>](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/financial-services/pdf/el-salvadors-law-a-meaningful-test-for-bitcoin.pdf). The US regulatory environment, though constrictive to most cryptocurrencies, [<u>has been significantly more amenable to Bitcoin</u>](https://watcher.guru/news/secs-gary-gensler-says-bitcoin-is-not-a-security).

In the past year alone, Bitcoin has taken tremendous mindshare among both investors and users. A series of BTC Spot ETF filings were released in July as [<u>Blackrock led the pack</u>](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/spot-bitcoin-etf/). And August saw [<u>Grayscale secure a vital victory against the SEC</u>](https://cointelegraph.com/news/grayscale-wins-sec-lawsuit), as the appeals court denied the SEC’s attempt to deny GBTC’s conversion to an ETF. On the user side, inscriptions dominated the Bitcoin landscape, bringing another creative use case to the seemingly latent chain. Although ordinal (non-fungible) & BRC-20 (fungible) inscription volume peaked earlier in the year, they have since sustained a large degree of their momentum, with [<u>average daily inscription mints increasing by 48.1% in Q3</u>](https://messari.io/report/state-of-bitcoin-q3-2023). The large Bitcoin fee uptrend can also be attributed the inscriptions rush.

RSK is also taking advantage of these advancing narratives. Through [<u>RSKIP-387</u>](https://github.com/rsksmart/RSKIPs/blob/master/IPs/RSKIP387.md), Bitcoin ordinals and inscriptions are looking to become available on RSK using the Powpeg bridge. In terms of projects, IOV Labs is [<u>funding</u>](https://rootstock.io/grants/) more than 5 ordinals-based projects that came out of the HackerEarth Ideathon + Hackathon.

# **Liquidity Bootstrapping**

Rootstock will commit $3M Rootstock-based tokens in Uniswap-specific liquidity. The tokens will be deployed on Uniswap through the Rootstock integration with Oku, the funds will be provided by IOV Labs. They will work to deploy the funds as follows:

* 1st Phase - Deployment: up to $400k into four liquidity pools for the following:
  * $100k in RIF/RBTC
  * $100k in RIF/rUSDT
  * $100k in RBTC/rUSDT
  * $100k in RIF/wETH

<!---->

* 2nd Phase - Growth: up to $1M to be distributed in the previous four liquidity pools created in the 1st Phase.
  * The amount to be added into the liquidity pools will be decided according to the trading volume growth in a period of 3 months for each pool.
* 3rd Phase - Expansion: up to $2M to be used in order to create new liquidity pools and token pairs.
  * IOV labs will create new liquidity pools according to market demand. These new liquidity pools will be a minimum amount of $100k.

The goal is to deploy the $3M within 12 months in several phases. While the proposed limit is $3M, IOV Labs may increase this amount based on the outcome and success of this initiative.

Track active pools, TVL, volume, and fee metrics via [<u>Oku’s RSK analytics page</u>](https://oku.trade/info/rootstock/overview?utm_source=uniswap\&utm_medium=forum\&utm_campaign=rootstocktemp).

# **Success Criteria**

Overall, we propose the transparent measurement of this project’s success through the following success criteria and long-term goals:

* At least a 30% increase in TVL across all initial pools during 2024, excluding the liquidity provided by IOV Labs
* At least a 100% increase in average RSK DEX trading volume across all initial pools in the first six months after the onchain proposal
* Successful adoption of Uniswap by the Rootstock community, aiming for a >20% increase in the number of active users by end of Q1 2024
* Continuous and sustainable maintenance of the Uniswap-RSK integration contract, ensuring optimal operation and long-term security

# **Deployment Details**

The approval of this proposal by Uniswap governance will lead the below Uniswap v3 contracts to be deemed as the canonical deployment on RSK. As is the case with all canonical v3 deployments, this deployment will be subject to Ethereum Layer 1 Uniswap Protocol governance and control. The text record of the uniswap.eth ENS subdomain titled v3-deployments.uniswap.eth will be amended to include the reference to the stated v3 contracts on RSK.

# Proposal Motivation

We at she256 are submitting this proposal on behalf of Zora Labs. Zora Network is an emergent ETH L2 built with the OP stack that has grown to more than [90k weekly active users](https://dune.com/queries/3102622/5177887) who drive [600k transactions every week](https://dune.com/jhackworth/zora-network). We propose a canonical deployment of Uniswap v3 on Zora benefitting creators, collectors, and builders of both ecosystems.

Zora Network is onboarding thousands of creators and collectors to Ethereum L2s through a distinctly creative brand and support from protocols like Mint.Fun, Holograph, PartyDAO, and the Zora Creator Toolkit. It is important for Zora Network’s ecosystem of creators, collectors, and developers to have access to premier crypto tooling, including DeFi protocols, that can help them protect and expand the value they are creating onchain.

We believe offering these tools is a material step in supporting creators as they explore and innovate with onchain media. This is particularly true as the amount of people and teams that earn ETH on Zora Network continues to grow from features like Zora’s Protocol Rewards.

This collaboration will position Uniswap to win long term market share on an emergent L2 network with a uniquely differentiated user base. And, it will signal the DAO’s ongoing support of the growing population of creators, collectors, and builders that transact on Zora Network everyday.

# Background

Zora Network is an L2 built on top of Ethereum using the OP stack [with over half a million addresses onchain](https://dune.com/sealaunch/zora-network) and just under 1000 ETH in transaction fees. Zora Network launched last summer on June 21st, the Summer Solstice. It is currently supported by industry leading infrastructure partners such as Rainbow, Opensea, Zerion, Dune, Layer Zero and many more. Zora Network supports a bustling ecosystem of creators, collectors and developers that are exploring creativity onchain.

## Creator and Collector Ecosystem

Zora Network brings a uniquely creative and NFT native audience to the Uniswap ecosystem. Many of the active users on Zora Network are the artists, collectors, and builders that makeup the onchain creative community. Zora Network makes up [30-34% of mint marketshare ](https://dune.com/queries/3216404/5377012)across Ethereum and its L2s ecosystem. In the last month, there were more than 40,000 NFT contracts created on Zora Network, and today [36% of all unique collectors ](https://dune.com/jhackworth/zora-network)across Ethereum and its L2 ecosystem are active on Zora Network.

Adoption of Zora Network comes alongside easy to use product features in the Zora Creator Toolkit like email signup and free creation, which position Zora to easily onboard first time users to crypto. As these users grow in their understanding of crypto, it’s important that Zora Network has brand aligned partners, like Uniswap, available to facilitate our users’ next steps in their crypto journey.

## Developer Ecosystem

The Zora Network developer ecosystem includes a lot of the core infrastructure that developer teams need to get started with a new project in crypto. There are [over 10,000 contracts deployed to Zora Network everyday](https://dune.com/queries/3102645/5177911). Examples of teams that support Zora Network today include infrastructure teams like Dune, Third Web, Tenderly, and Gelato as well key developer tools like Wagmi and Privy.

NFT native protocols like those mentioned above, Mint.Fun, Holograph, and Highlight, have also integrated Zora Network alongside others like [Gallery](https://zora.co/collect/zora:0x5921a344e85553d8ec7f8510917d38aaa8d21081) and [Fair XYZ](https://fair.xyz/). One of the more exciting integrations of late has been the [Warpcast](https://warpcast.com/) team’s launch of in-app minting of Zora Network NFTs powered by Warps. Lastly on the developer front — Protocol Rewards on Zora Network, specifically referral rewards, are proving to be [a new revenue stream](https://twitter.com/kylemccollom/status/1697237856962720076) for developers building aggregators, recommendation systems like [Daylight](https://www.daylight.xyz/), and mobile notification rails like [Interface](https://twitter.com/interfacedapp). Zora Network is still early, but it's proving to be valuable for developer teams of all types.

# Rationale for Uniswap on Zora Network

[Protocol Rewards on Zora Network](https://support.zora.co/en/articles/8192123-understanding-protocol-rewards-on-zora) makes the need for stablecoins and fiat on/off-ramps increasingly apparent. Creators, collectors, and developers in the Zora ecosystem are [earning six figures of ETH in protocol rewards everyday](https://dune.com/queries/3216223/5376687). For some creators, protocol rewards are helping to [pay their rent ](https://warpcast.com/tokenart.eth/0xfb0ded63)or just grab a slice of pizza. And for platforms, rewards are quickly becoming a core part of their business model and a key to their success.

There is a growing need on Zora Network for swaps and stablecoins that can better protect the value these individuals and teams create. Today, creators are required to bridge their ETH from Zora Network to a chain where Uniswap is supported, which costs gas and eats into their earnings. Only then will they be able to swap to a stablecoin. Adding swaps natively on Zora Network will make taking this action cheaper and easier for onchain creators that are making their living with Protocol Rewards.

Our goal with this proposal is to bring a canonical instance of world class DeFi tooling to Zora Network participants to help them more efficiently convert and expand their Protocol Rewards into value that they can transact with in their everyday lives. We think this is an exciting long tail opportunity for Uniswap.

### Uniswap on Zora Network enables

* Stablecoins for thousands of creators, collectors, and builders on Zora Network
* Swaps for Zora Network participants without needing to bridge funds
* Fiat payment rails to easily on and off ramps, for our creators, collectors, and builders
* Creating and transacting in additional token types ERC20 tokens
* Developer teams requiring liquidity pools for markets or experimentation

# Benefits to Uniswap

Uniswap would be the first DeFi protocol on Zora Network giving it a first mover advantage to win consideration from the network’s unique audience of creators and collectors.

## Expand the Uniswap Audience

Recent market data from cross-chain minting activations indicate that, when given the option and equal incentive, creators [tend to choose Zora Network](https://x.com/js_horne/status/1744719299460337785?s=20) as the destination for their work onchain. Uniswap and Zora Network coming together is a great opportunity to expand the Uniswap audience to Zora Network’s creative community.

Zora Network is home to tens of thousands of creators of all disciplines: visual artists, musicians, photographers, podcasters, and more. Incredible crypto native talent like Chase Chapman, Nick Hollins from UFO, and more have made Zora Network their L2 of choice. This is all happening alongside some of the world’s best YouTube channels like [Color Studios](https://colorsxstudios.com/collect) or breakout brands like [KidSuper ](https://zora.co/collect/zora:0x3a669992d78cf9fd0f23a589c152ea4d2c5e7ed0/1)making Zora their home as well.

Uniswap V3 on Zora Network is an opportunity for Uniswap to market to a new, non-DeFi audience that is excited to support one another’s creativity. You can get a feel for who makes up the Zora community in the latest [Me + My Imagination campaign](https://twitter.com/ourZORA/status/1735359375840297265/quotes).

## Increase DEX Marketshare

Uniswap will be the first DEX to come to market on Zora Network. It will start out with 100% marketshare on this emergent L2 network. The more than half a million addresses on Zora Network will have a single destination for DeFi.

Zora Network has an increasingly active user base with active addresses on Zora Network are up 50% MoM from December to January. And, that user base is earning ETH at a good rate with more than $100k of ETH paid out daily on Zora Network in Protocol Rewards. Given these earnings and these levels of activity, there is a good chance these users will need stablecoins and other opportunities to protect the value their creating.

## Commemorative Mint

Zora will mint a commemorative artwork to celebrate the launch of Uniswap V3. Zora plans to [split the creator rewards](https://support.zora.co/en/articles/8730492-split-contracts-on-zora) from this mint 70-30, with 70% of rewards from this mint at the discretion of the Uniswap DAO and 30% going to Zora. We will add the [Protocol Guild](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) as the beneficiary split recipient on this commemorative mint for Uniswap DAO's share of the split, benefitting core protocol development as collectors mint the artwork in celebration of the launch.

# Success Criteria

For Uniswap, this is a unique opportunity to become the sole DEX on Zora Network, a breakout L2 for onchain creativity. This will help Uniswap win increasing amounts of creator affinity as you support the thousands of active creators and collectors around the world using Zora Network.

In addition, we consider this successful for Uniswap if we are able to:

* Launch a successful commemorative mint to excite Zora’s community about Uniswap
* Onboard Zora’s onchain creative and developer community to Uniswap
* Partner with Zora on future Uniswap DAO activations, hackathons, etc.

We want to give network participants the tools they need to convert the value they create on Zora Network into stablecoins and real world currencies they can use everyday. By weaving Uniswap V3 seamlessly into this emergent network, we aspire to strengthen the ties between Uniswap and Zora, ensuring a mutually beneficial collaboration between both thriving communities.

## KPI Summary

**Brand Marketing**

* 7,777 unique collectors from Uniswap x Zora commemorative mint
* Increase Uniswap followers on Zora by at least 10k followers

## Front End Considerations

Zora will deploy the [open source Uniswap UI](https://github.com/Uniswap/interface) to a subdomain at <https://zora.energy.> This front end will be made available to all Zora Network users similar to <https://bridge.zora.energy.> Our goal is to ensure that there is an easy to use frontend interface for users to access the superpowers of Uniswap. Overtime, we will work with the Uniswap Labs team to get Zora Network added to the primary Uniswap website over time.

# Bridge Details

Zora Network is built on the open-source OP Stack. As a result, the bridge for Zora Network operates functionally identical to both OP Mainnet and Base – two OP Stack chains with canonical Uniswap V3 deployments already live. The bridge address is listed below, and more information on the OP Stack Bridge design is available [here](https://docs.optimism.io/builders/dapp-developers/bridging/basics). As a further convenience, Zora Network hosts a bridging interface at <https://bridge.zora.energy.>

## Timeline

This proposal has passed the RFC and temperature check phases. The relevant Uniswap v3 contracts have also been deployed on Zora mainnet.

Deploy Uniswap V2 on all chains with V3
## TL;DR

* The only canonical deployment of Uniswap V2 is on Ethereum mainnet.
* There is demand for V2-style AMMs on non-Ethereum chains and many V2 forks have been deployed with varying degrees of modification.
* To the extent that these forks have been modified, they may prove unsafe for users.
* To the extent that these forks have liquidity, that liquidity could likely have accrued to Uniswap V2.
* The combination of Uniswap V2 and Uniswap V3 can often provide better execution for small-volume swappers via the Universal Router.

## Introduction

When Uniswap V3’s [Business Source License](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/LICENSE) expired and the code’s license transitioned to [GPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html), the DAO [created a process](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-post-bsl-cross-chain-deployment-process-creation-of-new-uniswap-eth-subdomain/20961) by which it would declare canonical deployments of the contracts. This process serves to identify instances of the V3 code that are a) not modified and b) owned and controlled by the Uniswap governance contracts. These assurances are meant to provide developers and users with comfort that the code they’re using is safe and any changes to it (to the extent that changes are even possible) will be telegraphed long in advance.

Uniswap V2 is governed by the same permissive GPL license but has not been subject to the same DAO-run multi-chain expansion as V3. Instead, it has been forked and deployed under different brand names and across many chains almost continuously since Sushi’s vampire attack in the summer of 2020. These forks may contain modifications to the code, and their ownership structure can range from DAO governance contracts to single-signature wallets. Nevertheless, forks of V2 can garner [significant liquidity and volume](https://defillama.com/protocols/dexes/Base) relative to other AMMs.

## Proposal

Deploy Uniswap V2 on all chains where there is a canonical instance of V3.

## Rationale

There are at least three compelling arguments to move forward with this proposal.

First, V2 forks have been plagued by hacks that have caused the loss of user funds. The Uniswap V2 contracts have been deployed on mainnet since [May 4, 2020](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xc31d7e7e85cab1d38ce1b8ac17e821ccd47dbde00f9d57f2bd8613bff9428396) with no loss of user funds; they can be considered among the most battle-hardened contracts on Ethereum. Canonical versions of the Uniswap contracts can provide DEX users on new chains - swappers, liquidity providers, and developers - with the safety and security for which the protocol is known.

Second, there is demand for traditional, full-range AMMs on new chains. Uniswap should be in a place to service this demand and continue to grow our user base and brand equity across multiple ecosystems.

Third, integrating Uniswap V2 pools into the Universal Router will help incrementally improve execution quality for applications that already use the Router to allow their users to swap.

## Process

This process will be very similar to the first vote to [declare V3 canonical implementations](https://vote.uniswapfoundation.org/proposals/38). We will evaluate a batch of deployments, create a new ENS name, and populate the text record for each of those deployments. More specifically:

* Chains that have a V3 deployment have already gone through the community vetting process and should be eligible for a V2 deployment by default.
* V2 deployments should be owned by the same contract that owns the V3 deployment on its respective chain and subject to the same cross-chain governance mechanism
* V2 deployments should be cataloged in the text records of a new ENS subdomain v2deployments.uniswap.eth with the key equal to the network ID and the value equal to the bridge sender contract address and the destination chain’s UniswapV2Factory contract address

The relevant contract addresses can be found in [this Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I2viBd0SbYs8M83bC3HKvYh_zh8i2_CjMMbMfP9bPSk/edit#gid=0) or on the Forum in [this post](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-deploy-uniswap-v2-on-all-chains-with-v3/21799/12).&#x20;

## Vote Transaction Details

If executed, this proposal will execute two function calls.

1. Create the `v2deployments.uniswap.eth` subdomain by calling the `setSubnodeRecord` function on the ENS Registry [contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x00000000000C2E074eC69A0dFb2997BA6C7d2e1e) and passing it the hashed values of the main name (uniswap.eth) and the new subname (v2deployments) as well as the timelock's address and the resolver we're using (the ENS public resolver [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4976fb03C32e5B8cfe2b6cCB31c09Ba78EBaBa41)).&#x20;
2. Add the text records to the newly-created `v2deployments.uniswap.eth` by calling the `multicall` function on the ENS registry (since we have > 9 records to create and our governor contract can call max 10 functions per proposal). We pass `multicall` an array of the encoded bytes data for each function we want to call. Concretely, `multicall` receives an array of 14 items, each of which is the encoded bytes data for the function call that sets a text record in the format described above.

## TLDR

Uniswap v3 utilized its first mover advantage and achieved dominance on Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon, but on more recent EVM chains has seen limited market share growth.

The goal of this proposal is to take Uniswap on the offensive by actively supporting and incentivizing new deployments of Uniswap v3. If successful, we will be able to grow Uniswap's market share and increase the amount of volume growing through protocol-owned deployments rather than leaving the opportunity for more Uni V3 forks to grab market share.

To put Uniswap back in the driver's seat, this proposal creates an **Onboarding Package** that the DAO can proactively deploy to new EVMs and invite EVMs to seek out official Uniswap v3 deployments.

## How can we increase Uniswap’s market share?

* By supporting the latest emerging EVM chains and securing Uniswap a dominant position early
  * For example, Monad, Linea, Scroll, Polygon zkEVM, Bera, Taiko, etc
* By further investing in current deployments where Uniswap is not a dominant player
  * For example, Binance Smart Chain, zkSync, Base, etc

Since Uniswap v3 launched, little has been done to drive the growth of any Uniswap v3 deployments outside of Polygon, Optimism, and Arbitrum. Of which, each strongly benefited from early mover advantages. Today, there are 13 deployments of Uniswap v3. Many of the new deployments are newer chains that, while today, don’t have the usage seen on Arbitrum, Polygon, or Optimism, one or multiple of them will likely grow to be as big or bigger.

On each of these deployments, Uniswap is currently the underdog. We’re competing against Uniswap v3 & v2 forks and other concentrated liquidity protocols, which often have more focused resources for marketing and distribution than Uniswap and often boast close relationships with the chain’s team.

The good news is these chains are still generally nascent. So, if Uniswap acts quickly, it can take the lead spot and likely hold it thanks to its robust ecosystem of tooling and support.

## Introducing the Onboarding Package

It is high time we made getting Uniswap v3 on new EVMs easy. The package covers everything from deployment of contracts, data infrastructure, user interface, liquidity incentives, and tooling to distribute the incentives. With this package, the Uniswap DAO can go live on new EVM chains significantly faster.

GFX Labs will handle the deployment of Uniswap v3 core and peripheral contracts, verifying the contracts, making data available to other ecosystem projects and players via the [Oku API](http://oku.trade/api), and integrating the deployment into the Oku [trade](http://oku.trade/app) and [analytics](http://oku.trade/info) interface. [Angle Merkl](https://merkl.angle.money/) will handle the distribution of UNI rewards.

Lastly, the Uniswap Accountability Committee will escrow the funds in their multisig for the packages.

### Liquidity Incentives

Liquidity incentives will range between $250k and $1m and be voted in on a Temperature Check. Incentives will be distributed in UNI over three months. Once the three months are completed, delegates should look at the remaining liquidity and Uniswap's market share position to gauge the program's success. Overall, the program is meant get Uniswap's foot in the door and secure a stronger brand position on the chain.

The package will target 3-5 pools. Generally, mainstays like ETH/USDC, ETH/BTC, USDC/USDT, and one or two key local pairs. For example, MATIC/ETH on Polygon.

### Pricing

* For Oku to support a new chain, it’s $45k for the initial integration and $5k/month for 12 months. This covers deploying the contracts, getting the new chain onto the frontend, the Oku API (free), our onchain limit order functionality, our cloud costs for hosting the API, our global system for quoting, node requests, and DevOps maintenance.
  * Oku currently supports 11 chains. Any of the current chains or chains that we're already in the process of adding to the frontend do not necessitate an additional cost. Oku only charges for new deployments requested by the DAO.
* Angle Merkl has a one-time setup fee of €20k for going to a chain that they do not support. For chains they do support, but don't have Uniswap configured for the have a one-time setup fee of €10k. [Supported chains](https://docs.angle.money/merkl/supported-chains-amms)
  * Merkl charges 3% on funds distributed using their tool. They have offered a 25% discount on their base 3% fee for incentives distributed between $2.5m-$5m, a 50% discount on incentives distributed between $5m-$10m, and a 75% discount on all incentives above $10m in a 365-day period.

## First round of Onboarding Packages

The initial Temperature Checks ended two weeks ago. For links to them, go [here](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-revitalization-and-growth/22616/41?u=gfxlabs). For the Post-Temp check summary, go [here](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-revitalization-and-growth/22616/48?u=gfxlabs).

This onchain proposal funds the following Onboarding Packages. For pool and allocation info click [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1x1qve0heTIS_tp8bGbRV1ZK58D64-zSddpztM3KRDtQ/edit?usp=sharing).

1. Linea: $250k (w/Oku + Merkl)
2. Scroll: $250k (w/Merkl)
3. Polygon zkEVM: $250k (w/Merkl - UniV3 only)
4. zkSync: $500k (w/Merkl)
5. Blast: $500k (w/Oku + Merkl)
6. Base: $500k (w/Merkl)
7. BSC: $1m (w/Merkl)
8. Mantle: $250k (w/Oku + Merkl)

Based on a UNI price of $7.42 and a EUR/USD price of $1.08, the image below shows the investment the DAO will make by approving this proposal.
![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJ7831nsp.png)

The Uniswap Accountability Committee Multisg will receive the UNI, and Oku/GFX and the Angle team will work closely with them to get the infrastructure setup and incentives rolling on each of these chains.

## Conclusion

If this proposal is approved, when a new chain wants a deployment, we can offer this package and roll it out as part of the governance proposal. This would end the current status of rubber-stamping deployment proposals and provide a reason for new chains to seek the support of Uniswap governance proactively.

Uniswap could quickly take the lead on 5-10 chains through this initiative. If one of these chains grows into a major player (like Arb/Op/Poly), it will have paid for the entire program multiple times over (assuming the fee switch is someday turned).

Providing a modest onboarding package helps Uniswap diversify and develop new markets without waiting to see which chains become long-term relevant - at which point it is often too late or too costly to get market share."

In the future, the organization could consider upgrading our governance contract to make it easier to run multiple governance proposals.&#x20;

1. Sei’s onboarding package is $500k and includes the Merkl integration. The Sei team has committed to providing liquidity alongside Uniswap’s incentives ([more info](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswapgovernance.eth/proposal/0xe7274e00eb2a084cdc3b7510a8b40aa303ac2d7944e9706ad090c974c76e71bf)). The Sei has separately arranged to be integrated into Oku. Sei’s EVM launch has not yet occurred but is expected soon, and upon the AC's review, Sei will be added to the Uniswap v3 Deployments record under the new program. 
2. Manta’s onboarding package is $250k and includes the Merkl integration. Manta will match Uniswap’s $250k 1:1 with MANTA. After this proposal passes, the Manta team will work to deliver the tokens to the AC so UNI and MANTA rewards can be initiated at the same time. Manta, like Sei, separately arranged to be integrated into Oku’s frontend. This proposal also adds Manta to the Uniswap v3 Deployment record.
3. Taiko’s onboarding package is $250k and includes Oku and Merkl integrations. In addition to the incentives, the Taiko team will commit $250k in liquidity to the wETH/USDC 0.05% pool. Taiko was previously [<u>approved</u>](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswapgovernance.eth/proposal/0x178ac7eb76480798dbb656cbae4a405c3adaad48f9af4ae4c528b2cbd0f6af39) for a package in the original batch, but payment wasn’t processed in proposal 59 because their launch date was a while away. Their launch is now imminent. Taiko will be added to the Uniswap v3 Deployments record under the new program.
4. Moonbeam’s onboarding package is $250k and includes the Merkl integration. Moonbeam was previously approved for a package in the original batch, but payment wasn’t processed in proposal 59 because talks were ongoing with their team. As part of this proposal, passing Moonbeam will add $100k of GLMR to the protocol’s incentives. After this proposal passes, their team will work to deliver the tokens to the AC so UNI and GMLR rewards can be initiated at the same time.

**Authors: Uniswap Accountability Committee**

## TLDR:

* Today, Uniswap governance, via the timelock address, has the ability to declare a new v3/v2 deployment as official/canonical
* The DAO has set a precedent for approving EVM-based deployments over the past 2 years
* This proposal seeks to give the Uniswap Accountability Committee multisig agency over altering the v3-deployments.uniswap.eth & v2deployments.uniswap.eth subdomains
* This will allow the Committee to edit these text records whenever a new v3/v2 deployment is complete without having to go through an onchain vote
* To accommodate for this change, we are also proposing an alteration to the current deployment governance process (see “New Proposed Deployment Process” below) to increase efficiency
* The DAO will retain the right to assign incentive distributions from the treasury to these deployments via an onchain vote
* The DAO will maintain ownership of the primary domain, uniswap.eth, and thus have the ability to revoke the Committee's subdomain permissions through a governance vote–this assures proper checks and balances

## Background:

Over the past two years, the DAO has approved numerous EVM-based deployments for Uniswap v3. There has only been one instance of a deployment proposal that did not pass the off-chain stage due to not meeting quorum: [Fantom](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswapgovernance.eth/proposal/0x98e08d94e1174b0bfa2350c616d3cf2fb8f5e56c56c03dc0ae58fd29a6b29265). We believe that this sets a precedent for optimistically acknowledging incoming EVM-based deployments as canonical. The same precedent can be set for v2 since there was a recent proposal to [deploy v2 across all target chains with v3](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/uniswap/proposal/58) in one fell swoop.

The v3-deployments.uniswap.eth & v2deployments.uniswap.eth ENS subdomains act simply as records of the v3/v2 deployments that the DAO has “blessed”. From a legal as well as technical perspective, alterations to the subdomain don’t hold any weight–it’s merely a place onchain that the DAO can recognize v3/v2 deployments across various EVM chains. This way, there’s a public place to keep track of which deployments are official. Such recognition is important because it allows users and developers to ensure that the contracts they’re interacting with are representative of the real Uniswap (i.e. the Uniswap fork that has been approved by the DAO), thereby ensuring security and consistency across each fork.

When the DAO currently approves deployments onchain, only the v3-deployments.uniswap.eth & v2deployments.uniswap.eth text records are being altered. The actual contract deployment is completed by a third party, like [@GFXlabs](https://gov.uniswap.org/u/gfxlabs). In fact, the deployment has to be completed prior to the onchain vote since the text record alterations requires the

* The destination chain’s network number
* Bridge sender contract address on mainnet associated with the deployment
* UniswapV3Factory/UniswapV2Factory address on the destination chain

### Current Deployment Process:

* If a chain wants to deploy Uniswap, they typically connect with either the Foundation, the Accountability Committee, a delegate, or any adjacent party
* Anyone is able to author an RFC, whether it be a delegate, the destination chain themselves, or whoever else. That RFC is posted on the forum for a minimum of seven days to allow a discussion to transpire
* A temperature check takes place, allowing the DAO to either approve or deny the deployment of Uni v3/v2 on the given chain
* Once passed, the v3/v2 contracts are deployed on the destination chain–the deployer collaborates with an approved bridge provider if the EVM chain is not an L2 (i.e. doesn’t already have a canonical bridge)
* The onchain vote takes place, recognizing the deployed contracts as official on the subdomain

## Our Proposal

**We are proposing to enable the Uniswap Accountability Committee multisig to alter the subdomains as soon as a deployment’s RFC passes the 7-day discussion period–given there are no major points of contention during the RFC phase.** The RFC should give ample time to the DAO to make a decision regarding the deployment without having to partake in a 4+ week governance ordeal. And to make sure voters have a say in this process, we are including a 5-day challenge period that will be a part of the onboarding package temperature check–this will allow voters to voice their dissenting opinion regarding a deployment.

Currently, the Uniswap DAO, more specifically the timelock address (0x1a9C8182C09F50C8318d769245beA52c32BE35BC) owns AND manages both subdomains. This proposal would make the Accountability Committee the manager of the subdomains. If at any time the DAO would like to alter the manager again or regain control, this can be done via an onchain vote since the timelock still owns the subdomains.

### New Proposed Deployment Process:

**Step 1**

* If a chain wants to deploy Uniswap, they typically connect with either the Foundation, the Accountability Committee, a delegate, or any adjacent party
* Anyone is able to author an RFC, whether it be a delegate, the destination chain themselves, or whoever else. That RFC is posted on the forum for a minimum of seven days to allow a discussion to transpire
* The deployer can either have the contracts deployed at this point or not–if the deployment is complete, then include the contracts in the RFC
* **If no issues arise in the RFC, then the deployment will be viewed as approved, and a 5-day challenge period will be rolled into the onboarding package snapshot vote**

**Step 2 (Work for the Deployer and Accountability Committee)**

* If deployment hasn’t already been completed, then it must be done after the RFC phase
* As soon as contracts are deployed and verified, ensuring that the bytecode of the deployed contracts matches the bytecode of the mainnet contracts, the Committee will comment on the RFC confirming that the contracts have been verified&#x20;
* The Committee will then hold a temperature check to see if there’s interest in deploying incentives on the new fork–this vote also acts as the challenge period
* **Once the snapshot is completed, and the vote is not subject to a majority veto, the Committee has the authority to write the relevant text to the subdomain**
* The Committee will comment on the RFC confirming that the subdomain has been properly updated
* An onchain vote will then take place to send the selected amount of capital to the Committee multisig for distribution on the target chain

## Technical Implementation:

The onchain proposal needs to include the function calls below to grant the Accountability Committee write permissions to the subdomains. The DAO will maintain ownership of the primary domain, uniswap.eth, and thus have the ability to revoke the Committee's permissions through a governance vote and establish checks and balances.

**For Uniswap v3 Subdomain:**

setOwner(

&#x20;   node = 0x0b9638d2c5bd4528d603562a1fa1e734fe1b88e680f448d779531e9bc2b55f12,&#x20;

&#x20;   owner = 0x3B59C6d0034490093460787566dc5D6cE17F2f9C

)

**For Uniswap v2 Subdomain:**

setOwner(

&#x20;   node = 0x30e9fa72b4d7d40be0f8809d748497121d5f38ebf8700a7d2e303074e9ccf1a5,&#x20;

&#x20;   owner = 0x3B59C6d0034490093460787566dc5D6cE17F2f9C

)

## Next Steps:

*The Accountability Committee will retroactively alter the subdomain text record for any deployments that are approved and haven't been included in the subdomains after the approval of this proposal. The Committee will also add the text for deployments that did not go through the formal governance process from the* [*Uniswap Revitalization and Growth*](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-revitalization-and-growth/22616) *proposal.*"

### Summary:

* The Uniswap DAO's treasury, containing assets worth nearly ~$6B, predominantly in $UNI tokens, faces challenges due to its single-asset composition and the lack of a plan for productive utilization. 
* To address the treasury's volatility and underutilization, we propose forming the Uniswap Treasury Working Group (UTWG) to explore treasury management strategies aimed at achieving sustainability and growth for the DAO. The UTWG will examine various treasury plans for Uniswap DAO based on 8 weeks of research and interviews with various entities and individuals familiar with treasury management and adjacent subject matters. 
* The UTWG will be composed of four members. StableLab and Arana Digital are a part of working group zero (WG0). They have been helping administer and organize this proposal for the past couple of weeks. The other two members, Karpatkey and Franklin DAO, [<u>have been elected via a Snapshot vote</u>](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswapgovernance.eth/proposal/0x7584aabd34944953f37008d4a6209e4efee8f1a066a5051fbba37910dae80b49). The elected members, along with WG0, will be responsible for helping conduct research and aiding in proposing the final deliverables to the DAO. 
* A deliverable will correspondingly be released on the forum where we present at least two viable treasury management options for the DAO to begin pursuing. Both of these options will be presented as their individual RFC/RFP, ideally allowing various treasury managers to present their products and services to the DAO. The UTWG will help facilitate this process. 
* We hope that a simultaneous discussion around, say, DUNA, or other legal frameworks, takes place. It seems unlikely that the DAO will be able to conduct treasury management if it doesn’t open itself up to adopting a legal architecture. Our hope is that while the Foundation and potentially another working group sort out the legal side, we are able to make some strides on treasury management research. Upon adoption of a legal entity, we can then hit the ground running by actually implementing the conclusions derived from the UTWG’s research. 

![]()**Treating the Uniswap Treasury as an Endowment**

“Treasury” is a broad term that typically mirrors the nature of its underlying protocol. Some treasuries quite literally reflect a protocol’s balance sheet, where the holdings are used to cover capital expenditures, and income is either paid out as a dividend to token holders or used to further grow the protocol. Other treasuries are integral in managing risk, with Aave and Compound being prime examples. Then, some treasuries, like that of Uniswap, are structured more similarly to an endowment, where the DAO must manage a large pool of capital to further the sustenance of the protocol in the long-term.



The concept of an endowment refers to a collective pool of assets held by a nonprofit institution. These assets are employed to support an institution perpetually, with a clear directive of aligning with the desires of the contributing donor(s). In Uniswap’s case, the DAO was established upon the creation of the $UNI token–and 43% of the total supply was endowed to the DAO. 

![]()The goal of the DAO is to support Uniswap’s growth and development in a manner that aligns with the collective vision of the token holders and their entrusted cohort of delegates. These objectives can be achieved by funding development projects, liquidity incentives, community grants, and other programs that contribute to the ecosystem's growth and resilience. ***However, such pursuits cannot be facilitated without robust treasury management.***



### The Native Token Problem

The Uniswap treasury is often touted as one of the largest sums of capital at the disposal of a DAO. As of today, Uniswap’s treasury boasts nearly ~$6B of assets, larger than any other DeFi protocol. That number, however, is highly inflated due to the composition of the treasury. Nearly 100% of the treasury is solely composed of one asset: the native $UNI token. Hence, the value of the treasury, in dollar terms, should be massively discounted.

Imagine if a traditional endowment was allotted billions of dollars in a singular, volatile asset, with a directive of using that treasury to sustain its core business–preposterous, right? That’s exactly the position where Uniswap is. What’s more is that there’s no current plan to mobilize this treasury in a productive manner. There lies a large amount of dormant capital simply sitting in the treasury without any explicit plan to be utilized. From our perspective, there needs to be an initiative to spur this dormant capital into action, even if it means doing so little by little. ***The goal of this proposal is to create a committee to begin researching ways by which we can put this treasury into effect.*** 

 

### What Are We Optimizing For? 

**This proposal optimizes for two variables:**



1. ***Sustainability:*** the DAO should be a self-sustaining entity, able to cover its future costs in perpetuity. ****** 
2. ***Growth:*** the DAO should utilize its capital to grow its principal $UNI allotment in terms of dollars, thereby further propelling the adoption of Uniswap and delivering value to relevant stakeholders. 

Sustainability is the bare minimum. It acts as a floor. Unless the $UNI price continues to increase forever, the DAO, whenever it reaches into its treasury reserves, is reducing its runway. Hence, the first objective in any treasury management initiative should be to diversify out of the native token and into a more stable asset, like a basket of stablecoins. One could go as far as stating that any $UNI held in the treasury should actually be written down to zero. This mindset, where [<u>treasury $UNI is effectively treated as an unissued share,</u>](https://uncommoncore.co/a-new-mental-model-for-defi-treasuries/) should spur us towards diversification. 



Since crypto is prone to fat-tail events, the DAO should establish a more robust cushion in case the market crashes. In 2021, the Uni treasury value ran to nearly $19B, and it quickly fell into a limbo zone between $1.5B - $2B for nearly 1.5 years between Q2 2022 and Q1 2024. No endowment should be this volatile. We should be in a position where if the DAO needs to fund certain initiatives, there are reserves to draw from without causing significant impairment to the token price. For instance, when the Foundation needs to be funded again, it should ideally be the case that a large portion of those requested funds are given in the form of stablecoins for instant liquidity. 

Beyond mere diversification, the DAO needs to pursue growth. Currently there are no programs in place for the treasury to increase its net asset value beyond $UNI appreciation. This is where the treasury can be used to generate revenue, either from operating or non-operating activities. Let’s break this concept down–distinguishing between the operating and non-operating income for the DAO is important for defining the source of treasury growth. 



**Operating Income:** Operating income would pertain to any income generated from the primary business activities of the protocol, which, in Uniswap’s case, is fees from swaps. Currently, the DAO does not collect any income from fees and likely won’t in the future under the Uniswap Foundation’s [<u>recently proposed fee architecture</u>](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-activate-uniswap-protocol-governance/22936). ***The Uniswap DAO will therefore not be sustainable in the long-run by relying on income from operations–fees generated will most likely be paid out to token holders in full, leaving the DAO with near zero income. To that end, we must rely on non-operating activities to ensure the sustainability of the Uni DAO.*** 



**Non-Operating Income:** All income not generated from fees falls into this category. If the Uniswap DAO does not plan on attaining revenue from operations, then it must utilize its current treasury to collect income via alternative methods–likely through yield-bearing strategies and investments. Reliance on non-operating income further establishes why the Uni treasury mirrors the setup of an endowment, where the long-term sustainability of the protocol is built on indirect investments detached from the protocol’s core operations. ***These methods are to be further explored, and the present proposal aims to pioneer such exploration.*** 

### Working Group Details

Based on the above reasoning, the UTWG will conduct 8 weeks worth of research into the types of treasury management initiatives that the DAO may reasonably pursue in the short-to-medium term. The group will note on the experience of treasury management practices of other DAOs, adopting practices that have historically worked well and conforming them to Uniswap’s current situation, along with the presentation of new models that we believe are potentially more effective. Considering treasury management has been a key aspect of many prominent DAOs like Maker and Aave to Lido and Gnosis, we believe that there are many case studies and frameworks that can be explored to ensure initial experiments will return positive results. 



The UTWG will also try to collaborate with those working on various legal developments including the recent [<u>Wyoming Decentralized Unincorporated Nonprofit Association (DUNA) Act</u>](https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/duna-for-daos/). This process may fall outside of the jurisdiction of the treasury committee and may require outsourcing entirely to another party. It’s vital that this treasury research is analyzed in the context of potential legal structures, and we won’t move forward with implementing our research unless there are proper legal frameworks in place. The Uniswap DAO has yet to formalize its opinions on how to set up legal entities, so this caveat may delay the implementation of the proposed treasury initiatives. The UTWG’s research may conclude that a legal working group should work in concert with the treasury group to effectively bring this program to fruition. 



It’s also important to emphasize that the deliverables of the UTWG will aim to highlight potential treasury management options rather than pinpointing specific service providers. If the committee comes to the conclusion that an RFP process is the ideal manner by which treasury managers should be appointed, for example, then one of the UTWG deliverables will be a call to action for various service providers. After ample discussion in the forum, the most promising service providers will qualify for a vote of confidence from the DAO. We will communicate with the Uniswap Accountability Committee to determine how monitoring of this program will proceed in the long run. Depending on a handful of factors, like how much time it’ll operationally take to implement treasury management, it may be best to have the Committee act as the liaison between the treasury managers and the DAO–or out of the UTWG’s research, it may pose more beneficial to sustain this working group long term. The UTWG will also have to communicate with the DAO after the 8-week period to flesh out any further details regarding the proposal, hence there will likely also be an extensive feedback period. The exact structure and timeline regarding the operations beyond the 8-week period are to be determined, and we will keep the DAO posted regarding updates around this process. 



Note that it’s too early in the research process to conclude the exact operations of the treasury initiatives–the above paragraph simply outlines a potential order of operations, which is subject to change based on our research. ***Our*** ***goal is to simply present the DAO with an assortment of options, backed by interviews and research.***



**The Uniswap Treasury Working Group Members**



The UTWG will be composed of four members. StableLab and Arana Digital are a part of working group zero (WG0). They have been helping administer and organize this proposal for the past couple of weeks. The other two members, Karpatkey and Franklin DAO, have been elected via a Snapshot vote. The elected members, along with WG0, will be responsible for helping conduct research and aiding in proposing the final deliverables to the DAO. 



***StableLab***

* StableLab is a governance firm focused on professional delegation, DAO framework design, and product development. StableLab works with various projects, from the ones just starting their journey to decentralization to the most prominent DeFi protocols. They are the leading professional delegate team with a track record across major DeFi protocols, including MakerDAO, Optimism, Aave, 1inch, Balancer, and more. 



***Arana Digital***

* AD is a professional governance group. The team is deeply steeped in the crypto space and has multiple years of participation in protocol governance. With delegation history for DEXs, money markets, L2s, liquid staking protocols, and stablecoins. AD brings a diversity of experience to DAOs–its members have consulted for companies like Immutable and dYdX, worked at crypto investment and trading firms, set up various validator nodes, and run educational events for university students. 



***Franklin DAO***

* Franklin DAO has been an active member of Uniswap’s DAO since we first became delegates ~2 years ago. They pride themselves on having strong working relationships with key members/delegates of the DAO, and contributing in a way that promotes the sustainability and growth of Uniswap. Their team has a variety of experience in directly managing risk + incentives via market parameterization and ML modeling (Ion Protocol). They’ve also worked at notable venture funds like Portal, Galaxy, and Big Brain.



***Karpatkey***

* Karpatkey has been an active delegate in the Uniswap Protocol since August 2023, with a 93% participation across all voting actions. In addition to our Uniswap DAO contributions, Karpatkey has historically deployed a combined $62.91M worth of LP positions in both Uniswap V2 and V3. They have a team of DeFi engineers, treasury managers and analysts who regularly lead DeFi incentive programs and actively manage treasury assets for various protocols. They serve in treasury roles for AAVE, Balancer, CoW Protol, ENS, Gnosis DAO and Lido.

**Budget** 

The UTWG asks for a budget of 6,000 $UNI. The hourly rate will be the same as the Accountability Committee at $200 per hour. This onchain requests to send the mentioned UNI amount to the Accountability Committee multisig (0x3B59C6d0034490093460787566dc5D6cE17F2f9C). At the end of each month, each of the 4 UTWG members will submit a receipt of worked hours, and the Committee will correspondingly pay the members’ wallets. Retroactive compensation will be distributed to WG0 based on their input hours by the start of the program (i.e. once the onchain vote passes). 

### Next Steps

This program will take effect starting the week of May 20th and will conclude during the week of July 15th–at which point the UTWG will present its research publicly to the DAO. The conclusions from the research will determine the timing of a potential RFP process/implementation of the stated treasury management initiatives. The exact structure and timeline regarding the operations beyond the 8-week period are to be determined, and we will keep the DAO posted regarding updates around this process."

**Proposal Overview**

[Temp Check](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswapgovernance.eth/proposal/0xf17f3ca6b3d1aa6d8061a733fc0d627558159e0057f76ddfe056ea492cf56163)

[Governance Thread](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-supporting-the-defi-education-fund/23631/)

Since its founding via a timely Uniswap Governance governance proposal in 2021, the [DeFi Education Fund ](https://www.defieducationfund.org/) (DEF) has fought to advance and protect the potential of DeFi in the public policy sphere. The threat that misguided policies and overreaching regulators pose to DeFi has never been clearer. [GFX Labs](https://twitter.com/labsGFX) is bringing this proposal  to a vote to provide DEF with one million UNI tokens in two tranches to support them in fulfilling their mission, half of which will be locked up in a streaming contract that will “vest” linearly over 12 months. Governance can vote to stop the streaming of those tokens at any time.

DeFi promises to revolutionize how people engage in economic activities. In particular, the openly accessible and decentralized characteristics of DeFi protocols means that anyone with an internet connection and a wallet can participate in the global economy in a way that would not be possible without DeFi. To do so, DeFi upends the structure of traditional financial services and related policy making approaches. That upending has brought with it intense interest, suspicion, and hostility from entrenched interests and regulatory bodies around the world.

DEF has defended DeFi from legislative threats that would require DeFi developers to implement protocol access restrictions or requirements designed for CeFi businesses; regulatory proposals that would mandate centralization if finalized; and in the courts against overzealous regulators. In late March, we sued the SEC over its policy on airdrops and its campaign of regulation by enforcement that is crippling DeFi and crypto development and participation in the United States.

Over the last few years, DeFi’s policy challenges have become more real, more imminent, and more numerous. For example, in the U.S. alone, there are at least half a dozen bills actively under consideration in Congress and two rulemakings pending finalization that would effectively prohibit DeFi development. Luckily, public policy education and advocacy has borne—and can continue to bear—fruit for DeFi.

Without doubt, building a public policy environment welcoming of DeFi and decentralized governance will be a long and arduous struggle, but we know that Uniswap Governance shares our commitment to winning that debate—and it is winnable—so that the benefits of DeFi can be felt and enjoyed by as many people as possible, as quickly as possible.

DEF is eager to continue leading the fight on behalf of DeFi. With additional resources, we can build out our team:

1. super charge our impact litigation efforts to reshape the legal landscape to DeFi and DAOs’ benefit;
2. expand our outreach to legislators and double down on our educational efforts;
3. more vigorously challenge the regulatory onslaught targeting DeFi; and
4. enhance our ability to engage in state-level debates and jurisdictions outside of the United States.

If DeFi development and DAOs are to have a future in the United States, we need to double down on our advocacy efforts to protect DeFi from the myriad policy risks it faces while proactively laying the foundation for longterm policy solutions favorable to DeFi and DAOs. We stand ready and able to do so with the community’s backing and appreciate your consideration.

**Rationale**

DeFi’s policy challenges are immense and interest in DeFi has only grown since the DEF got to work in 2021. Following the collapse of FTX and with the return of the bull market, there is acute interest in DeFi on Capitol Hill and state legislatures, as well as inside federal and state government agencies. Providing meaningful educational outreach about DAOs and DeFi to lawmakers while also assisting in the legal defense of decentralized organizations is a role not played by anyone else in the US.

At this time, DAOs and DeFi protocols face several potentially catastrophic threats: a live IRS proposal would mandate the creation of intermediaries to conduct tax reporting (i.e., ban on disintermediated systems) and a live SEC rulemaking would define anyone loosely related to a DeFi protocol—including the underlying chain’s miners/validators—to be national securities exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange. Moreover, bills written to regulate CeFi often inadvertently capture DeFi protocols and subject them to compliance obligations designed for CeFi businesses.

If DeFi development and DAOs are to have a future in the United States, we need to double down on our advocacy efforts to protect DeFi from these myriad policy risks while laying the foundation for longterm proactive policy solutions favorable to DeFi and DAOs. There is a reason TradFi businesses collectively spend over $1 billion per year on U.S. lobbying and policy efforts: it works, and we’re making it work for DeFi.

DEF focuses specifically on fighting for policy outcomes favorable to decentralized finance developers and users on the ground in Washington, DC. A summary of our past work, which has included defending DAOs in court, as well as providing comment and consultation to regulators to avoid burdensome rules and regulations in the US and around the world, below. This proposal would expand our budget so that we can expand our legislative, regulatory, and legal advocacy and education efforts on behalf of DeFi and DAO developers and users.

If DeFi development and DAOs are to have a future in the United States, we need to double down on our advocacy efforts to protect DeFi from policy risks while proactively laying the foundation for longterm policy solutions favorable to DeFi and DAOs. We stand ready and able to do so with the community’s backing, and we appreciate your consideration.

**Conclusion**

The DeFi Education Fund is a nonprofit organization with a demonstrated history of being in the trenches fighting for DAOs and decentralized finance. Whether looking to provide legal assistance when DAOs and their members are targeted, providing educational resources, or fighting for policy changes, the DeFi Education Fund is the only major crypto advocate that focuses solely on decentralized web3.

**FAQs**

*Why are you raising money now if you have about two years of runway at your current burn?*

We are seeking Uniswap Governance’s further support now for three primary reasons.

First, we need a good sense of our longer term funding in order to expand our efforts and take on the long term projects that our work often requires, which can play out over several years. For example, our legal challenge of the patent covering oracle tech that is being used against DAOs will likely take a total of at least two years from start to finish. Our lawsuit against the SEC will probably last several years. If we did not have a good expectation of being able to operate two years after starting those efforts, we would not have been able to take them on at all. In addition, because we hold tokens long term, we are exposed to crypto market price fluctuations.

Second, unexpected, ad hoc projects that we are well-positioned to take on in defense of DeFi can be extremely expensive. For example, we expect the challenge to the oracle patent to cost nearly $500,000 over its entire course. A legal challenge to proposed rules that would de facto ban DeFi in the United States would cost well over $1m. We have no ability to predict with certainty when and if those expenditures will be necessary, and without a sense of our longer term funding situation, we can’t take on those types of unexpected, but critical, projects while also expanding our day to day efforts and team.

DeFi needs more dedicated advocates working on its behalf. With a larger budget, we can hire more people.

*When and how would you plan on selling this proposal’s tokens?*

It is important to us that DEF remains aligned with the DeFi community and our supporters over the long term. Upon passage, 500k $UNI tokens will be transferred to DEF’s on-chain Coinbase $UNI [wallet](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb39cb7Eb25CE07470Fb59F7548979Fae0Bb85824), and 500k will be locked up in a streaming contract that will “vest” linearly over 12 months. Governance can vote to stop the streaming of the remaining tokens at any time.

We will hold half of any tokens we receive for at least 12 months from the date we receive them, and we will pre-disclose all sales plans in writing.

*How are you going to keep Uniswap Governance up to date on your activities?*

The DEF team will host monthly community calls that Uniswap community members can join to hear updates on our work, learn about high priority policy and regulatory developers, and have questions answered. We’ll also keep a thread on the Uniswap governance forum up to date with our monthly updates.

*What about the tokens from the 2021 proposal?*

We received our initial grant of one million $UNI tokens from the Uniswap Governance in July 2021 and sold half of the tokens shortly thereafter. In February 2024, we began selling portions of the other half of the tokens according to an 18 month written [sales plan](https://www.defieducationfund.org/post/def-provides-update-on-our-funding). We will sell in July 2025 the last of the UNI tokens we received in July 2021.

*Why are you asking us for money and not other DAOs?*

We are, and we will definitely continue to “pass around the hat”! We seek Uni governance’s continued support as a community that is building for the long term. Uniswap Governance took a massive “leap of faith” in generously funding an organization that did not yet exist to do work that would benefit every DeFi project and DAO. We hope that our track record of work has proven valuable to DeFi projects and users such that Uni governance and other projects’ governance will continue to contribute to our work going forward."

**Summary**

This proposal outlines the Uniswap Delegate Reward Initiative, a compensation program designed to improve participation quality and dedication among Uniswap delegates. The initiative was developed by several members of the Uniswap Delegate Reward Working Group, which conducted extensive research and produced findings supporting the implementation of such a program.

**Background**

In late February 2024, StableLab proposed the [Uniswap Delegate Reward Initiative](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-uniswap-delegate-reward/22909). After the GovSwap event in Denver, further research to plan and implement the Delegate Reward Initiative was highlighted, leading to the formation of the Uniswap Delegate Reward Working Group, composed of 8 members from different organizations. After extensive research for more than a month, the Working Group produced several findings, which can be found [here](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/findings-from-uniswap-delegate-reward-working-group/23702).

The details of the findings were slightly different. However, this conclusion summarized the findings quite nicely:

*“There was a general consensus across most categories that a compensation program for delegates could improve participation quality and dedication. However, the enthusiasm varied, with those deeply involved in governance showing the strongest support.”*

The Uniswap Delegate Reward Working Group explored several frameworks for implementing rewards, including a Committee structure that allows several non-delegates to get rewarded for helping to contribute to various scopes. However, some non-delegates in the Working Group preferred the Delegate-only model while other non-delegates in the Group suggested other alternatives.

Therefore, we believe that the delegate-focused structure can be launched, but other members can also propose structures that focus on different aspects, ultimately leaving the decision up to governance.

**Proposal Details**

**Qualified Applicants for the First Cycle**

There were 14 delegates who qualified for the application and applied for the first cycle. After examining both Voting Participation, Proposal Authorship, and Other Governance Participation, top 12 delegates were chosen. The details can be found [here ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WXf8Z2AnLIyKGNKYjKKsfb-c-d1hmCLAX-5rYAbiHDk/edit?usp=sharing).

**Delegate Reward Eligibility**

The qualified Delegates need to fulfill the following to be eligible for up to $6,000 USD worth of $UNI reward per month.

**Requirements**

1\. Maintain 80% onchain and offchain voting participation for the past 3 months. Achieving this will provide $3,000 USD worth of $UNI

**Additional (only available if the above Requirement of Voting Participation is fulfilled)**

2\. Write rationale for the voting on their delegate profile. Achieving this will provide an additional $3,000 USD worth of $UNI

**Budget**

We are requesting 216,000 \[ 6000 \*3 \* 12] USD worth of UNI for the Uniswap Delegate Reward Initiative, plus an additional 64,000 USD (40 hours \* 8 members \* 200 USD per hour) worth of UNI as a retroactive reward for the Uniswap Delegate Reward Working Group. The Working Group members will be required to share their hours.&#x20;

The total amount of 280,000 USD worth of UNI, 27,000 UNI at the time of the writing, once approved, will be sent to the Accountability Committee, which will be responsible for the monthly distribution of rewards to eligible delegates and retroactive reward for the Working Group members. In the unlikely scenario that the budget is depleted before the end of the 3-month cycle, Cycle 1 will end early.&#x20;"

### TLDR:

* In April, the UADP submitted an application to participate in the Arbitrum LTIPP (long term incentive program pilot)
* We were able to receive 1,000,000 of ARB, the largest amount out of all other DEX applicants
* In our application, we stated that “the UADP will request the Uni DAO to decide whether or not it wants to partially match this 1.0M ARB ask. The options the DAO has to vote on are four: $250k, $500k, $750k, and $1M. We cannot guarantee that the DAO will vote to match incentives, but we will make a best-effort attempt and report the results of the temperature check”
* We will be collaborating with Gauntlet and Merkl to distribute the incentives (cost breakdowns are below)
* To those ends, we are running this temperature check to see if the DAO is interested in matching the given LTIPP grant to some capacity

### About the LTIPP Application

Uniswap did not apply to the first two rounds of Arbitrum incentives (STIP 1 & 2). This was for two reasons:

* Native DEXs and smaller protocols deserve a chance to make a name for themselves and perhaps offer unique protocols for trading
* We did not have a formal structure like the UADP to help facilitate an application

Since many native DEXs–and non-native ones–have already had the chance to apply for ARB incentives throughout the past year across multiple incentive distribution initiatives, the UADP decided that it’s now the right time for Uniswap to also partake in these programs, especially since other blue-chip protocols also applied for these incentives. Plus, the establishment of this committee has allowed Uniswap DAO to further mature its relationship with Arbitrum DAO. We’ve partaken in multiple discourses, participating in all of the votes taking place on Arbitrum since November 2023.

The LTIPP pilot program is a 3-month long incentive program, with 45M worth of ARB to be distributed among an elected group of protocols. A total of 174 applications were vetted by the LTIPP Advisors, with whom we interacted and obtained feedback during the month of March. One of the primary sticking points was the amount of capital that we initially requested, along with clarifications around some of the target KPIs behind our request.

After some deliberation, in line with many other projects, we ended up lowering our ARB ask from 2.5M to 1M, which increased our chances of being admitted into the program by the Advisors and ARB delegates. Uniswap was able to attain the largest amount of incentives from the cohort of DEX applicants:.

### Uniswap LTIPP Grant Structure and Execution

Below is a breakdown of how the LTIPP funds will be used:

* 900k ARB for incentives: 882k ARB: The bulk of these funds will be used to incentivize liquidity providers on Uniswap using Gauntlet’s dynamic optimization engine. 18k ARB: For Merkl to distribute the funds. Merkl charges based on a percentage of the incentives distributed.
* 85k ARB for Gauntlet: they will dedicate part of its Applied Research team, the same team currently managing the Uniswap/Arbitrum liquidity mining program, to this initiative.
* 15k ARB for UADP: These funds will be sent to the UADP multisig with the goal of making this meta-governance initiative a self-sustaining program. This will allow Uniswap DAO to maintain its voting participation in the Arbitrum DAO.

In order for us to accept this grant, we had to elect three signers onto a Gnosis Safe, and each member had to follow Arbitrum Foundation’s KYC process.



Multisig Address: 0x1026D3D219098D7b1B0A180F7E557DEeA7DA82C1 (⅔ Signers)

* @Juanbug (UADP), 0xB8Dcad009E533066F12e408075E10E3a30F1f15A
* @AbdullahUmar (UADP), 0x3d0e30031b547737fFCf13c127350159A6C4ce17
* Picodes (Merkl), 0x34Eb88EAD486A09CAcD8DaBe013682Dc5F1DC41D

All performance reporting will be conducted by Gauntlet, just as they have been providing analytics regarding their previous Arb-Uniswap incentive program.

### Incentive Matching

It’s clear that Uniswap has a steeped history with Arbitrum. We are currently the dominant DEX by TVL and volume on the L2. After ETH L1, Arbitrum is where Uniswap has the largest stronghold. It is therefore important for delegates to potentially consider doubling down on this ecosystem.

Uniswap DAO and Arbitrum DAO have also conducted themselves symbiotically ever since Uniswap launched on the L2 in August, 2021. Below are some contributions that Uniswap has made to the Arbitrum ecosystem in the past year alone:

* Gauntlet has shipped out a Dynamic Incentive Optimization for Uniswap V3
* Uniswap/Arbitrum liquidity mining mid-point retrospective
* Set up a Uniswap-Arbitrum Working Group
* Funded a ~$2m Uniswap-Arbitrum Grants Program
* Created an active Metagovernance group (Uniswap-Arbitrum Delegate Program)

As mentioned, it is up to Uniswap delegates to decide whether or not matching is favorable. Doing so would signify to the Arbitrum community our continued support, and in the UADP’s opinion, allow for further collaboration and grants in the future. If any funds are approved, they will follow a similar distribution structure and execution as above and be grouped together in Gauntlet’s incentives allocation.



We recently ran a snapshot where the options were: $1m, $750k, $500k, $250k, Do Not Fund

The snapshot finished with the winner being $750k, hence we will move forward with this being the amount proposed. We will use the price of $9.74 per UNI for calculations.

# Uniswap Onboarding Package - Gnosis Chain

Outline

* Overview
* Motivation
* About Gnosis Chain
* Benefits to Uniswap
* Cost and Timeline
* Stakeholders

### Overview

Gnosis Chain is a community-owned, EVM-compatible network operated by a diverse set of 200k+ validators around the world. In the last two quarters (Q4 2023 and Q1 2024), Gnosis Chain experienced significant growth reaching over $300 Million in TVL. The DeFi sector added numerous established blue chip projects and now powers a vibrant ecosystem including Spark, Aave, Balancer, Curve, CoW Swap, 1inch and Connext among others.

Since Gnosis Chain’s focus on revolutionising the payments infrastructure to make decentralized financial tools accessible and usable for all, we feel it fitting for Uniswap to tap into the ecosystem.

This proposal requests a retroactive Onboarding Package for Gnosis Chain.

### Motivation

While already deployed on Gnosis Chain, Uniswap is not currently capitalizing on it. This proposal aims to change that.

One of the key areas of focus suggested by the Uniswap Deployments Accountability Committee to expand the Uniswap ecosystem is “Uniswap Revitalization and Growth”. In their recent work, a large emphasis is on revisiting some of the old deployments and proactively capturing first-mover advantage on promising new chains.

As Gnosis Chain experienced significant growth across Q4 2023 and Q1 2024, we believe the chain aligns perfectly with the scope of the Uniswap Revitalization and Growth initiative. Uniswap’s deployment on Gnosis Chain was completed in early 2022, hence Gnosis Chain was never a beneficiary of the “Onboarding Package” that is now included as a standard element of deployment proposals.

We believe there are synergies between Uniswap and Gnosis Chain as well as a strong potential for Gnosis Chain to generate high volumes and mobilize an influx of new users to Uniswap because of its focus on payments and financial tools.

As a comparison, Balancer processed over $590 Million in volumes YTD (end of May) on Gnosis Chain, making it the second-largest alternative EVM market for the DeFi protocol (similarly to Uniswap, Arbitrum is the first). Gnosis Chain has a larger positive impact on Balancer’s volumes than other more prominent networks like Polygon ($284M YTD) or Base ($80.8M YTD).

We believe that additional visibility and an incentive program would enable both Uniswap and Gnosis Chain to tap into their synergies resulting in positive growth on both ends.

### About Gnosis Chain

Gnosis Chain is a community-owned, EVM-compatible network operated by a diverse set of 200k+ validators around the world. It features fast transaction times (5 seconds) and low transaction fees (500 tx for $0.01) with the unique advantage of having a stable token as a base asset for transactions and gas fees.

One of the first Ethereum sidechains, Gnosis Chain’s core values are resilience and credible neutrality. By allowing contributors to easily run a node, Gnosis Chain created a community-owned, anti-fragile network secured by a geographically diverse validator set. Its strong culture of at-home stakers (not reliant on cloud providers or data centres) and its community governance ensure Gnosis Chain remains credibly neutral at a lower price point than Mainnet.

Gnosis Chain underpins the Gnosis collective of aligned projects revolutionising the payments infrastructure to make decentralised financial tools accessible and usable for all. The collective features established blue chip projects like Safe as well as prominent ones like Gnosis Pay and Monerium.

In the last two quarters (Q4 2023 and Q1 2024), Gnosis Chain experienced significant growth reaching over $300 Million in TVL. The DeFi sector added numerous established blue chip projects and now powers a vibrant ecosystem including Spark, Aave, Balancer, Curve, CoW Swap, 1inch and Connext among others.

### Benefits to Uniswap

The [Multichain Uniswap](https://blog.uniswap.org/multichain-uniswap) approach has proven successful with approx. [35% of trading volumes](https://tokenterminal.com/terminal/projects/uniswap) in the last 6 months come from non-Ethereum-Mainnet deployments.

Since Gnosis Chain’s focus on revolutionising the payments infrastructure to make decentralized financial tools accessible and usable for all, we feel it fitting for Uniswap to tap into the ecosystem. The potential for Uniswap to capture the inflow of new and existing users leveraging Gnosis Chain as a payments infrastructure is a promising opportunity for the project to reach a new audience.

Gnosis Chain underpins the Gnosis collective of aligned projects, building synergic services to Uniswap. Among those, Safe and Gnosis Pay. Safe Smart Accounts count 9.1 Million accounts deployed with $100B+ in total assets stored and VIP individuals (e.g. Vitalik) using them. Gnosis Pay is the world’s first on-chain spending account with a Visa Debit Card linked to a self-custodial blockchain wallet, connected with 80 Million merchants worldwide. Roll-out in Europe and the United Kingdom has already started, with upcoming new Countries including Brazil and Argentina. That is a combined population of approx. 1.45 Billion people.

Additionally, Gnosis Chain powers a growing DeFi sector with numerous blue chip projects added since Q4 2023. These include Aave, whose market on Gnosis Chain has grown rapidly since its launch 7 months ago and is now larger than the lending protocol’s markets on Base and Scroll (as of May 2024). sDAI (MakerDAO’s interest-earning DAI) accumulated over $68 Million TVL since October 2023. Focusing on the on-chain trading vertical, Balancer processed over $590 Million in volumes YTD (end of May) on Gnosis Chain, making it the second-largest alternative EVM market for the DeFi protocol (similarly to Uniswap, Arbitrum is the first). This means, Gnosis Chain has a larger positive impact on Balancer’s volumes than other more prominent networks like Polygon ($284M YTD) or Base ($80.8M YTD).

Based on the above and observing Uniswap’s performance across blockchains, we anticipate the protocol will replicate its success in capturing market share on Gnosis Chain.

### Bridges

Gnosis Chain is committed to providing easy and secure access to Ethereum L1 and other Layer 1 and Layer 2 ecosystems. For this reason, multiple bridging options are available to connect with Gnosis Chain.

The [Omnibridge](https://docs.gnosischain.com/bridges/About%20Token%20Bridges/omnibridge) is a native token bridge that connects Ethereum and Gnosis Chain (and vice-versa) by minting the canonical representation of bridged assets on Gnosis. The Omnibridge is built on top of the [Arbitrary Message Bridge (AMB)](https://docs.gnosischain.com/bridges/About%20Token%20Bridges/amb-bridge), a key bridge primitive that is used inside higher-order bridges like the Omnibridge and allows Gnosis contracts to send data and trigger contract functions on Ethereum and vice-versa. Therefore, the Omnibridge relies on the same trust models and group of [Trusted Bridge Validators](https://docs.gnosischain.com/bridges/management/validators#amb--omnibridge) as the AMB. Part of these validators is Succinct Lab’s zkSNARK-enabled Light Client, Telepathy. Telepathy is a key component of the AMB bridge ecosystem as it enhances security and reliability for cross-chain transactions by providing validity proofs via zkSNARKs that ensure trustless verification of transaction events across chains.

The [xDAI bridge](https://docs.gnosischain.com/bridges/About%20Token%20Bridges/xdai-bridge) is a native DAI bridge from Ethereum that is used to mint and burn xDAI, the native asset used for gas and transaction fees on Gnosis.

Gnosis has a long-term roadmap to move towards trustless bridges and is investing resources into trust-minimization of its bridges, to ensure trust and safety of users. [Hashi](https://crosschain-alliance.gitbook.io/hashi) is an EVM Hash Oracle Aggregator designed to enhance cross-chain bridge security by aggregating block headers from various sources. It supports 15+ General Message Passing bridges and ZK light clients, promoting redundancy and reducing reliance on single mechanisms. By requiring validation from multiple independent mechanisms, Hashi ensures greater resilience against security incidents. Gnosis plans to [gradually migrate](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-93-should-gnosisdao-support-the-integration-of-hashi-within-gnosis-chains-canonical-bridges/8245) its canonical bridges to Hashi’s distributed trust model with the goal of strengthening security, decentralisation and interoperability.

Additionally, Gnosis Chain is supported within independent bridge solutions that enable the cross-chain connection with other Layer 1 and Layer 2 ecosystems. These include Jumper (provided by Li.Fi), Bungee, Hop, Connext, DLN (debridge), LayerZero, Chainlink CCIP and Wormhole.

Cost and Timeline
This proposal has passed the snapshot with $250k being the winning option. This is addition to the $105k Oku deployment and $21.6k Merkl integration fee. Given the price volatility of UNI recently, we will take a price of $5 per UNI, resulting in 75320 UNI.

### Summary:
This proposal proposes deploying Uniswap v3 on X Layer. GFX Labs is sponsoring this proposal on behalf of X Layer.

* X Layer will provide $1m of liquidity for a minimum of 6 months via a community multisig.
* Uniswap DAO to provide the front end [cost](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-revitalization-and-growth/22616?u=gfxlabs) for Oku Trade.
* At a later date, OKX may create a new proposal seeking UNI incentives.

### Background:
X Layer is a zkEVM Layer 2 network built on Ethereum, powered by Polygon CDK, a zkEVM stack for building Ethereum L2 scaling solutions. Developers can easily deploy their existing contracts on zkEVM, and users can move their assets from Ethereum and conduct transactions off-chain. These transactions are bundled into groups with zero-knowledge proofs to verify their validity.

### Motivation:
Deploying an instance of Uniswap v3 on X Layer provides numerous opportunities for Uniswap to gain millions of new users from the OKX ecosystem which comprises of approximately 50m. This deployment will be a win-win for both parties as it provides Uniswap with a new user base and revenue stream and X Layer the chance to offer its users access to a battle tested DeFi primitive, which is Uniswap v3.


**Boundless scalability:** 100% EVM compatibility and easy-to-use developer tools for deployment.

**X Layer is Powered by OKX:** seamless integration to all OKX products, all-in-one Web3 gateway, and access to 50M+ users in the OKX ecosystem.

**Security:** rely on robust secure mechanisms from Ethereum, with trustless interoperability.

**Low fee:** same coding experience as Ethereum but 100x cheaper.

**Portal to Web3:** enter the world of Web3 via OKX Wallet, built with compact infrastructure modules to create innovative DApps.

![](https://static.tally.xyz/21494c79-f103-40f1-9368-a9b2d88a297f_original.png)Uniswap Delegate Reward Initiative - Cycle 2

**Authors:** [@Doo\_StableLab](https://gov.uniswap.org/u/doo_stablelab) [@PGov](https://gov.uniswap.org/u/pgov) [@AranaDigital](https://gov.uniswap.org/u/aranadigital)

## Summary

This proposal outlines the Uniswap Delegate Reward Initiative - Cycle 2, a compensation program designed to improve participation quality and dedication among Uniswap delegates following the conclusion of Cycle 1.

## Background

In late February 2024, StableLab proposed the [Uniswap Delegate Reward Initiative 14](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-uniswap-delegate-reward/22909). After the GovSwap event in Denver, further research to plan and implement the Delegate Reward Initiative was highlighted, leading to the formation of the Uniswap Delegate Reward Working Group, composed of 8 members from different organizations. After extensive research for more than a month, the Working Group produced several findings, which can be found here: [https://gov.uniswap.org/t/findings-from-uniswap-delegate-reward-working-group/23702 7](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/findings-from-uniswap-delegate-reward-working-group/23702)

Incorporating these findings, the Uniswap Delegate Reward Initiative–Cycle 1 was [proposed 4](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temp-check-uniswap-delegate-reward-3-months-cycle-1/23837) and [launched 2](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/uniswap/proposal/64) in June 2024.

## Success of Cycle 1

The 12 delegates that were selected under Cycle 1 maintained 100% voting participation rate for both offchain and onchain votes during this period. In addition, the Delegate Reward Initiative discussion attracted several new delegates.

New Delegate NameDelegate Join DateSEEDGovMay 2024CuriaJune 2024TanéJune 2024BobbayJuly 2024WhetstoneJuly 2024

## Learnings from Cycle 1

While Cycle 1 was simple and effective, there were several suggestions to have a tier system to incorporate different participation levels of delegates. In addition, various suggestions were shared on how to make a points system to determine the top delegate applicants more fair and objective.

## Cycle 2 Proposal Details

**Application Eligibility**

* There will be a week-long period for delegate candidates to submit their applications. Top 15 delegates will be determined based on points.
* Delegates from Cycle 1 must apply again for Cycle 2–they will not be automatically included.
* Delegates that have joined less than 3 months can also apply for the Initiative.

**Delegate Reward Eligibility**

Once delegates have passed the application process, they must fulfill the following requirements to be eligible for up to $6,000 USD worth of $UNI reward per month.

**Requirements**

1.Maintain 80% onchain and offchain voting participation for the past 3 months. Achieving this will provide $3,000 USD worth of $UNI

Additional Rewards (the below are only available if the above Requirement of Voting Participation is fulfilled)

2a. Write rationale for the voting on their delegate profile.

2b. Attend Uniswap Community Calls.

Achieving these above will provide an additional up $3,000 USD worth of $UNI.For 2a and 2b, it allows proportional payment. For example, if there were 4 votings and 1 community call, and a delegate missed to write a rationale of 2 of the votings. The delegate would be eligible to receive $1800 \[3/5 \* $3000].

## Uniswap Delegate Reward Cycle 2 Metrics

In case there are more than 15 eligible applicants, the top 15 will be chosen by the following objective metrics. The highest number of available point would be 10.

**1. Voting Participation**

-Considering one of the primary roles of the delegate is to receive voting power from their delegators to vote on behalf for the best of Uniswap, voting participation is crucial to ensure quorums are met and malicious proposals are prevented. The total point amount from this category is 6. The onchain part is weighted more heavily due to its usual frictions such as gas cost, as well as its ability to dictate governance contract alterations and movement of treasury funds. The voting rate is based on the past 6 months.

**1. Offchain Voting (Snapshot)**

1. 80% and above : 2
2. 70% till 80% : 1.5
3. 60% till 70%: 1
4. 50% or below but above 0%: 0.5
5. 0% : 0

**2. Onchain Voting**

1. 80% and above : 3
2. 70% till 80% : 2.25
3. 60% till 70%: 1.5
4. 50% or below but above 0%: 0.75
5. 0% : 0

**3. The date of the first on chain vote is 3 months or more (this is to counterbalance very new applicants who have few votes and able to get full points on the voting)**

1. Yes : 1
2. No : 0

**2. Proposal Authorship**

-Helping to write proposals for Uniswap DAO is important. However, we also want to prevent low-quality or malicious proposals. Therefore, only passed votes would count. The total points for this category is 3. The onchain part is weighted more heavily once again.

In case of non-binary proposals, if the choice equivalent to “No” was present, and the end voting result was another choice than “No”, then it would be considered as valid for below. For example, Uniswap Treasury Working Group (UTWG) Election wouldn’t be valid for the points as there’s no “No” vote . But \[Temp] Uni Onboarding Package - BSC would be valid for the points as there was a choice of “Against”. And the voting result was “$1m”.

**1. Authored or Co authored a proposal that passed offchain (snapshot) vote before.**

1. Yes, 2 or more : 1
2. Yes, 1 : 0.5
3. No: 0

**2.Authored or Co authored a proposal that passed onchain vote before**

1. Yes, 2 or more : 2
2. Yes, 1 : 1
3. No: 0

**3. Other Governance Participation**

-The full point for this category is 1. This category is to recognize other ways one could contribute to discussion regarding Uniswap Governance. This can be achieved by either

**1. Joined Uniswap Gov Workshop Before**

1. Yes: 1
2. No: 0

Or

**2. Joined Uniswap Community Call Before**

1. Yes: 1
2. No: 0

**Tie Breaker**

-Ties will be decided by the date of the first on chain vote these applicants casted in order to reward those delegates that have been contributing to Uniswap governance for an extended period.

**Budget**

We are requesting 540,000 \[6000 USD \*6 Months \*15 Delegates ] USD worth of UNI for the Uniswap Delegate Reward Initiative, which would be 84,000 UNI

The total amount, once approved, will be sent to the Accountability Committee, which will be responsible for the monthly distribution of rewards to eligible delegates and the proposal authors. Since the total budget of the now disbanded Delegate Reward WG has not been fully used, administration of this reward program–including the creation of this proposal and the admin work behind verifying monthly delegate participation–will be paid for using the current balance of $41.6k. The monthly admin consumption will be communicated each month to the DAO."

Just like the [1 bp fee tier 1](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/polygon-1bp-fee-tier/16488) originally proposed 3 years ago by Getty Hill, we propose to additionally add a 2, 3, 4 bps fee tier to Uniswap v3 on Base.

You may question why we are proposing the creation of three new fee tiers when our analysis only focused on 4 bps. There are two reasons for this. For one, Aerodrome is able to adjust fees automatically on Base. We anticipate they may respond by lowering fees below 4 bps and want Uniswap Protocol to allow LPs to move without governance intervention if this happens.

Second, we believe this analysis may be a single case study into a larger finding that the required fee for LPs on L2s may be lower than 5 bps. While Aerodrome highlights the success of a 4 bp fee tier, it’s unclear whether that’s the right market rate. It may be lower.

Lastly, we note that this change should not be blindly repeated on other chains. The community should do further research on the success or failures of this program before executing it on another chain."

## Descriptions

**UAC Renewal S3**

For the full proposal, please see [this forum post](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-accountability-committee-uac-season-2-report/24492).

The UAC has ramped up contributions in its current iteration, demanding more hours from members than in the past. Collectively, with our new much expanded scope, we have contributed more than originally expected, which was the limited 10 hours/month per member. In total over 6.5 months, committee members have worked 359 hours, 99 hours more than the expected 260 hours for this time frame. Note that the extra hours have not been paid out. Today, the scope of the UAC can broadly relate to DAO operations, program oversight, and protocol growth–the specifics of these categories will continue to evolve to meet the needs of the DAO.

Going forward, we propose a few key areas of focus for the committee:

* Proposing new incentive programs, including a potential exploration into Protocol Owned Liquidity and other forms of growth beyond mere incentives
* Administering an operational framework for the Uniswap DAO to best sustain efficiency with ever increasing programs and working groups
* Continuing our role as an escrow service for DAO-funded programs
* Polishing our accounting and record-keeping to improve reporting
* Exploring and implementing growth programs related to Uni v4

To accommodate this expanded focus, we propose the following next steps to operationalize the committee going forward:

* Add an additional member (going from 4 to 5 members) to increase work capacity and multisig security
* Increase the maximum hours per member from 10 hours/month to 30 hours/month
* Institute a staggered election system to retain three current members on the committee–this helps retain momentum and continuity with existing projects. We believe a degree of stickiness with the UAC team is important since conducting the noted operations requires subject matter expertise and familiarity with the DAO.
  * Going forward, the UAC will internally hold a vote to decide which of the ⅖ members will be up for reelection–that is, if two members don’t resign by default
  * For this election, @0xpibblez has stepped down, so there are automatically 2 available seats for the Season 3 election
* Approve the $32.6k of wages payable to accommodate for Season 2 overtime
* Fund the committee with an additional $210,000 of $UNI for payroll through March 2025 (this assumes that all 5 members spend 30 hours per month for all 7 months, given the $200/hour rate)

*Note: The UAGP is funding legal research into an entity structure that would be suitable for the UAC. This would, among other aspects, allow the committee to sign incentive matching agreements with protocols to which Uniswap is being deployed. The introduction of a legal entity may change the dynamic of the UAC and its election setup as well.*



### Approved Budgets Rebalancing

For the full proposal, please see [this forum post](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-accountability-committee-uac-season-2-report/24492).

Fluctuations in the UNI token price means that the accounts for various programs become unbalanced–sometimes at a surplus and other times at a deficit. Since programs are almost always budgeted in terms of dollars, we are looking to top up those balances to ensure liabilities around sustaining elected DAO programs are covered. This temperature check associated with rebalancing is being run separately from the UAC Season 3 renewal vote–the vote will request 42,060 UNI.

Further details on the request and breakdown of budgets can be found at the forum linked above.



### Uniswap Delegate Race Tiebreaker

Upon conclusion of the cycle 2 for delegate rewards, two candidates were incredibly close for the last 15th spot. More information and rational can be found on this [forum post](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-delegate-reward-initiative-cycle-2-application/24434/34) regarding specifics of the tiebreaker.

**Simple Summary**

This proposal seeks to onboard Forse by StableLab as a data service provider, helping analyze the effectiveness of the Uniswap Revitalization and Growth Program. The offchain vote was [passed](https://snapshot.org/#/uniswapgovernance.eth/proposal/0xdf2d95ccfadebf141847b90e058f8fafb4f76d8ca2ec2a7351d93353187df560) in early August of this year, and for a month, we have discussed with various Uniswap DAO participants to incorporate their feedback.

**Feedback Incorporated**

**1. Accountability and Completion Based**

-The budget once the onchain vote passes will first go to the Uniswap Accountability Committee. Once the Committee confirms that the work has been completed, StableLab can claim the budget. If a StableLab member is on the Committee, one will not interfere and leave the decision to other Committee members.

**2. Budget and Scope Changes**

-Initially, the RFC requested $70,000 worth of UNI to analyze the impact of the Uniswap Revitalization and Growth Program for 3 blockchains chosen by the Uniswap DAO, this was expanded to 4 blockchains for offchain vote following the feedback. However, there were more suggestions for reduced scope and lower budget. Thus, the Analytics will cover 3 blockchains but at a reduced cost of $60,000, effectively reducing the cost by $10,000 compared to the original proposal.

**3. Preventing Redundancy**

-There have been concerns that the work on Arbitrum especially might overlap with Gauntlet’s research on incentive programs on Arbitrum. We are in active talks with the Gauntlet team and will also ensure the work doesn’t overlap with Gauntlet’s domains.

**Motivation**

In February 2024, the Uniswap DAO introduced the Uniswap Revitalization and Growth Program, which incentivizes users to participate in current and new deployments of Uniswap on different networks within the L2 space. The initial onboarding packages of this program cost the Uniswap DAO at least $3.5M worth of assets.

We propose that Uniswap DAO engage with Forse, our DAO intelligence and analytics platform, to analyze the impact of the Uniswap Revitalization and Growth program and assess if the current approach drives real growth.

By assessing the impacts of the Revitalization and Growth Program, the Uniswap DAO will have valuable insights to improve further iterations of the Revitalization and Growth Program or other incentive programs. Armed with this information, Uniswap DAO will be able to understand what was the most relevant user groups, and their acquisition cost, and evaluate if the Revitalization and Growth program effectively modified user behavior and led to increased stickiness of users, and therefore TVL and other top-level protocol metrics.

Recently, StableLab supported the Arbitrum DAO as the Program Manager for the [Arbitrum Short-Term Incentives Program](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/long-term-incentives-pilot-program/20223), and we delivered a comprehensive [analysis](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stablelab-analyzing-stip-s-efficacy-and-ltipp-comparison/24777/) of the STIP to the Arbitrium DAO.

With Uniswap allocating over $3.5M worth of assets for the purpose of growing Uniswap’s market share, it is essential to ensure that the DAO analyses and reviews the impact of these incentives on an ongoing basis.

**What is Forse?**

[Forse](https://www.forse.io) is a data and intelligence platform built by StableLab helping DAOs analyze the impact of governance decisions in protocol growth, top-line metrics, and governance operations, including its cost and effort structures. [StableLab](https://www.stablelab.xyz/) is the leading provider of governance products and solutions for decentralized protocols. We work with various projects, from the ones just starting their journey to decentralization to the most prominent DeFi protocols.

This service provider engagement grants the Uniswap DAO access to the services of the entire StableLab team. Specifically, three StableLab team members will be the primary points of contact.

**Team**

**Christian Ziegler** is the Tech Lead at StableLab. Previously, he worked as a researcher at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), where he wrote his doctoral thesis on DAOs. In 2018, he co-founded Blockcurators GmbH. Christian has several published scientific articles, including [a Taxonomy of DAOs;](https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/doc/1709396/document.pdf) [scoring methodologies for DAOs;](https://www.mdpi.com/1911-8074/16/7/330) [network analysis of DAOS; ](https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/doc/1742459/document.pdf)and [classification of DAO proposals using LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07059); among others.

**Johannes Loewe** is the Data Lead at StableLab, where he focuses on all stages of AI and ML development, from experimentation to deployment. Before joining StableLab, he was a Freelance AI & Blockchain Software Engineer. He also has experience with DAOs, being a founding member of PretzelDAO in Munich. He holds a Bachelor's degree from Radboud University in the Netherlands and a Master's degree in Machine Learning from NUI-Galway in Ireland.

**Marcos Miranda** is the Head of Product at StableLab. With over 5 years of experience in Product Management, focusing on Web3 and Analytics products, he is also experienced in building DeFi protocols, having previously worked for other protocols in the space.

**Specification**

By analyzing the impact of these incentives, Forse by StableLab hopes to identify the following:

* Impact quantification of the Uniswap Revitalization and Growth Program in top-line protocol metrics with the isolation of external factors influencing these metrics as far as permitted and reasonably possible.
* User segmentation and analysis based on archetypes of users to determine the types of users attracted through the incentive program.
* Post-incentive user retention, reactivation, and user acquisition cost metrics.
* Per-dollar value of incentives compared to other ways of incentivizing users (e.g. Airdrops, LP rewards, grants, ..).
* User Retention and activity patterns over the time of the Uniswap Revitalization and Growth Program.

To see Forse in action, explore our [interactive dashboard](https://dashboard.forse.io/main/arbitrum/grants_program/Short_Term_Incentives_Program) showcasing the Arbitrum Short-Term Incentives Program. This provides a great example of what our output could be for Uniswap’s Revitalization and Growth Program.

**Budget Request**

The proposal requests $60,000 worth of UNI, which is 8700 UNI to analyze the impact of the Uniswap Revitalization and Growth Program so far for 3 blockchains chosen by the Uniswap DAO, with 3 months of additional maintenance support and updates to analytics modules utilized in the live dashboard.

**Three Blockchains Among Chosen by the Uniswap DAO**

| Blockchains | TVL      |
| ----------- | -------- |
| Arbitrum    | $2.596b  |

**Methods** 

* K-means with Euclidean distance for user groups based on transformed transactions 
* Difference in Difference Analysis and Interrupted Time Series Analysis to separate the effect of the growth program from the effect of the market 
* The remaining analysis using further advanced statistical analysis

**Specification**

By analyzing the impact of these incentives, Forse by StableLab hopes to identify the following:

* Impact quantification of the Uniswap Revitalization and Growth Program in top-line protocol metrics with the isolation of external factors influencing these metrics as far as permitted and reasonably possible.
* User segmentation and analysis based on archetypes of users to determine the types of users attracted through the incentive program.
* Post-incentive user retention, reactivation, and user acquisition cost metrics.
* Per-dollar value of incentives compared to other ways of incentivizing users (e.g. Airdrops, LP rewards, grants, ..).
* User Retention and activity patterns over the time of the Uniswap Revitalization and Growth Program.

To see Forse in action, explore our [<u>interactive dashboard</u>](https://dashboard.forse.io/main/arbitrum/grants_program/Short_Term_Incentives_Program) showcasing the Arbitrum Short-Term Incentives Program. This provides a great example of what our output could be for Uniswap’s Revitalization and Growth Program. Our **Deliverable** would be an interactive dashboard hosted on dashboard.forse.io on at least the metrics stated above.



**Budget Request** 

The proposal requests $60,000 worth of UNI, which is 7,500 UNI (at the time of the updated proposal) to analyze the impact of the Uniswap Revitalization and Growth Program so far for 4 blockchains chosen by the Uniswap DAO, with 3 months of additional maintenance support and updates to analytics modules utilized in the live dashboard.

### Full Forum Post: [Here](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-uniswap-growth-program-trial/24703/1)

### Authors

AlphaGrowth and our sister company ReservoirDAO are DAO service providers primarily working in the realm of DeFi growth through grants, BD, growth-marketing, and DeFi Operations. Our marquee partner is Compound.Finance, where we run all things growth, business development and marketing for the DAO.

#### Co-authors for Uniswap Ecosystem Incentives Initiative section

Uniswap MetaGov Team: @PGov and @AranaDigital; The team first formed as the UADP to focus on Arbitrum’s governance and ecosystem. After applying and receiving 1M ARB in grants for the Uniswap DAO, it was deployed over 3 months and recently concluded. With this success, the UADP, now MetaGov team, is looking to deploy this framework across other chains. The team consists of long-time community members and delegates who have participated as contributors through multiple working groups and have worked across various committees and grant programs in Uniswap and across DeFi.

### How we got here

Over the last few market cycles, we cut our teeth in the world of grants, BD, go-to-market, tokenomics, and ecosystem growth. We’ve helped dozens of projects go multichain. Throughout this process, members of Compound DAO encouraged us to design and implement a comprehensive growth program to address stagnation in the protocol. As of today, we lead growth for Compound.Finance.

[Here](https://www.comp.xyz/t/alphagrowth-quarterly-report-400m-added-in-tvl-and-user-growth/5717) is the most recent quarterly report on our growth program at Compound. For a comprehensive view of AlphaGrowth-led Compound Growth Program, check out this [Dune Dashboard](https://dune.com/woof_team/alphagrowth-compound-growth-dashboard?growth_program_start_date_d7517c=2024-05-26+00%3A00%3A00).

### What’s the problem?

Currently, there is little outbound business development.
Uniswap Labs is not currently focused on expanding the protocol to new chains, creating an opportunity within the DAO. Additionally, the UAC has done an exceptional job in facilitating the middle of the pipeline. However, to continue scaling Uniswap’s impact and user base, there is a growing need to strengthen the initial and final stages of the business development process.

Uniswap lacks a structured outbound business development strategy, limiting new chains and strategic partnerships. This reliance on inbound interest restricts Uniswap’s growth. Without outbound, valuable opportunities are being missed, and Uniswap risks falling behind competitors who take a more aggressive approach in pursuing partnerships and integrations. The current reactive approach slows expansion into new markets and ecosystems.

Teams like Oku are often marketing new deployments and incentives on their own—efforts that could be amplified by the Uniswap ecosystem if a mechanism were in place. At present, the lack of a standardized process for co-marketing initiatives is causing missed opportunities for growth.

### We’re leaving incentives on the table.

Although Uniswap is live on over 25 chains, we aren’t currently capitalizing on the numerous incentive programs that are up for grabs. Without a team dedicated to securing and effectively distributing these funds, valuable opportunities for growth and user acquisition are being missed out on. Here are some concrete examples:

* Optimism Grants Council: Potential to secure ~$1 million each year in incentives for Uniswap users
* Scroll: Recently closed applications to a grants program awarding six figures to ecosystem projects
* Chains like Taiko, Mantle, Rootstock, Boba, and Linea offer incentives that Uniswap is eligible for but not is taking full advantage of.
* Other chains have expressed interest in creating one-off grants for incentivizing activity within their ecosystems
* Projects including Circle (USDC) have spoken to us about ways to incentivize utilization, but channels for doing so are currently unclear to them.

### What solutions do we propose?

Our plan of action includes an outbound business development team, a dedicated marketing team, and a team committed to securing grants and incentives for Uniswap users.

#### A Dedicated Outbound Business Development Team

To maximize opportunities at the top of the funnel, we will deploy our crypto-native team to spearhead outbound business development for the Uniswap Protocol. The objective is to consistently deliver high-quality opportunities to the UAC and the DAO, streamlining and enhancing the current process.

With this proactive strategy, we will engage new opportunities before our competitors do. This is crucial in sustaining Uniswap’s leadership position in the DeFi space.

Our team will work closely with the UAC, Oku, and others to identify the best opportunities to prioritize the roadmap for future Uniswap deployments. Some of these targets include new chains and integrations like wallets and bridges. Our immediate focus includes targeting the various new EVM chains launching on the horizon, in addition to the abundance of opportunities within the OP Superchain and Arbitrum Orbit. Further, as the Uniswap v4 rollout is iterated upon launch, we will work hand in hand with relevant stakeholders to ensure target chains are aware of v4’s value proposition. This may include DeFi, CeFi, and TradFi.

To further support our DeFi BD team over the years, we’ve built a Telegram-native CRM specifically designed to manage growth efficiently and effectively. We’ll touch more on this later.

#### A Dedicated Marketing Team

To ensure these new opportunities and incentives are shared far and wide, we propose leveraging our growth-marketing team. As we secure these grants and incentives, our mission is to strategically promote and distribute this alpha across the DeFi space, increasing TVL, volume, and activity on Uniswap.

Based on the success we’ve had running campaigns around the distribution of millions in incentives to Compound users, the primary marketing channel we recommend is Twitter. Promoting engaging content will help mitigate the cold-start problem of building a following. Additionally, ensuring visibility on industry-leading platforms such as CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko will keep Uniswap top-of-mind for ideal audiences. If there are other channels that the DAO would like to see activated, we are more than happy to entertain these options.

Further, we will work with Blockchain Ads, one of our tried and true partners, to facilitate targeted marketing efforts. Together we will leverage on-chain data to reach high-value wallet owners. To maximize engagement, we’ll also leverage Layer3’s interactive quests to gamify onboarding and increase user awareness and retention.

Over the past year, the DAO has approved the deployment of Uni V3 on over a dozen EVMs, but there has never been a DAO-led push to ensure that individuals outside of the DAO are aware of these deployments and the incentives that accompany them. We will act as that bridge between the DAO and the broader DeFi community. Our job is not to make up new stories, but to curate, manage, and amplify the stories that already exist inside the Uniswap ecosystem.

### Uniswap Ecosystem Incentives Initiative (UEII)

We will be working together with @PGov and @AranaDigital on the UEII (Initial post here: [UEII](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uniswap-ecosystem-incentives-initiative/24548)). Their team first formed as the UADP, focusing on Arbitrum’s governance, applied and received a 1M ARB grant for the Uniswap DAO a few months ago. This grant was deployed over 3 months and recently concluded. With this success, the UADP, now MetaGov team, is looking to deploy this framework across other chains. Together, with our team at AlphaGrowth, we propose leveraging our dedicated team to distribute the most value to Uniswap users and help the Metagov team, focusing on securing grants and incentives for the DAO and Uniswap users.

The initial focus will be on chains where Uniswap is currently deployed, capitalizing first on the lowest-hanging fruit. Depending on the goals of the issuing partners, these grants and incentives can be distributed in several ways: allocated to liquidity providers on specific chains / liquidity pools (e.g., stablecoins, LSTs, LRTs), used to subsidize transaction costs and trading fees, or directed toward other creative initiatives.

When reaching out to prospective chains, the UEII team will leverage our experiences and contributions across these chains as all of us are already involved across different target ecosystems. We’ll utilize existing DAO programs like the Uniswap Onboarding Package to strengthen our claim and pitch, working hand in hand with each chain to secure the maximum incentives possible for the DAO.

Oftentimes these grants require KYC/KYB, which we’ll handle through ReservoirDAO, AlphaGrowth’s sister company DAO LLC in the Marshall Islands. This is how we’ve successfully claimed and distributed incentives for Compound as we’re fully doxed and ready to facilitate the process.

### Trial Period

Given the long sales cycles associated with business development, marketing, and grant sourcing, we are proposing a 6-month trial period for this program. These initiatives will require time and space to cultivate impactful relationships and attain measurable results. 6 months will provide a reasonable window to build momentum and gather meaningful insights, while still leaving room for any necessary strategic adjustments.

### Budget Request

Funds will be sent to the Uniswap Accountability Committee. $420k will be then sent to AlphaGrowth. For the UEII, since we do not know exactly how much in grants we can secure for the DAO, a $500k “reserve” has been set side for the UEII success fee. This “reserve” will be held in the separate DAO trusted entity (UAC), and the UAC will NOT send funds for the UEII until grants and incentives have been sourced for the DAO. This should reduce governance overhead from having to vote in funding each time and ALL remaining “reserve” funds after the 6 month trial period will be returned to the DAO.

A forum thread updating the community on each UEII sourced grant and distribution/program specifics will be created and continuously updated.

## [](#p-54690-summary-1)Summary

Tally has been actively supporting Uniswap DAO since December 2020, less than 3 months after the UNI token was launched in September 2020. We are excited to continue building for the Uniswap DAO by enhancing the governance experience and rolling out key developments to further strengthen the Uniswap DAO’s onchain governance infrastructure. To continue providing these services and pursue future improvements, we are requesting $250,000 annually for 2 years.

## [](#p-54690-motivation-2)Motivation

Tally is the leading interface for Uniswap DAO’s onchain governance. Over the past 6 months, 75% of Uniswap DAO’s proposals were created on Tally with an average of 55.2% of onchain votes being cast on Tally.

Tally has been deeply engaged with the Uniswap DAO, providing essential governance infrastructure that has enabled its success. Our goal is to further enhance Uniswap’s governance capabilities and create an even better experience for the community.

Tally’s importance has grown over time, as Uniswap Labs has stopped maintaining [Sybil.org](https://sybil.org/#/delegates/uniswap) and removed voting from the [app.uniswap.org](http://app.uniswap.org) interface. We believe it’s important for the decentralization of the DAO to have many great interfaces for governance. The best way to ensure that is to fund them.

We believe the DAO should have the flexibility to allocate resources to the governance platform that best serves the DAO’s needs. Many DAO contributors and delegates have expressed support for using multiple governance interfaces. The Uniswap Foundation engaged Agora for a similar-sized grant. Tally plays a critical role in Uniswap DAO governance—**currently it is the only platform that allows for the creation of proposals** in the Uniswap DAO (all other proposals are created via command line). Tally’s no-code proposal tools, including the ability to create private drafts of proposals to be shared and edited among delegates, are highly popular with Uniswap proposal creators.

## [](#p-54690-proposal-details-3)Proposal Details

We are seeking this grant to:

1. Ensure Tally can continue supporting the Uniswap DAO’s governance needs with the same level of commitment.
2. Develop new features and improvements that will make participation in Uniswap DAO governance more accessible and effective.
3. Build a stronger, more seamless user experience tailored to the growing needs of the Uniswap DAO community.

Our focus is on the future. With this grant, we plan to build out features that will create a deeper, more robust governance experience—one that scales with Uniswap’s growth and helps contributors make impactful decisions.

**(1) The Uniswap DAO relies on Tally for governance.**

Tally is the preferred governance platform for Uniswap DAO delegates and contributors, providing a simple and efficient way to vote, delegate, and participate in governance discussions. Uniswap DAO members consistently use Tally to engage in the decision-making process. As the DAO grows, Tally continues to play a critical role in facilitating transparent and effective governance.

Tally is the most popular onchain governance platform in the Uniswap DAO, and it’s becoming more popular over time.

In total, Uniswap contributors use Tally for both proposal creation and proposal drafting:

* 80 created proposals
* 67 non-test drafts

**(2) Tally has consistently rolled out key features and improvements that have enhanced the governance experience for Uniswap DAO.** These include:

* **UNI Staking Support:** Launched on August 16, 2024, allowing Uniswap DAO members to [stake UNI directly on Tally](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/uniswap/stake).
* **Gasless Delegation:** Since May 2023, Tally has relayed delegation transactions for the Uniswap DAO via its funded budget, making delegation free for Uniswap DAO members.
* **Import from Discourse & Snapshot:** Seamless import of proposals from Discourse or Snapshot with just a link, ensuring a smooth proposal drafting experience.
* **Secure Voting Mechanisms:** Providing a reliable voting platform that empowers token holders to make decisions securely and transparently.
* **Proposal Automation:** Automating the execution of approved proposals to simplify governance.
* **Proposal Creation with Arbitrary Executables:** Proposals can be created with customizable executable actions, including a [custom “recipe” in Tally’s docs for chain deployment of Uniswap v3](https://docs.tally.xyz/knowledge-base/proposals/creating-proposals/custom-actions/chain-deployment-of-uniswap-v3).
* **Collaborative Proposal Drafting:** Enabling multiple contributors to draft proposals together for a more inclusive governance process.
* **No-Code Transfers:** Making fund transfers within the DAO simple and accessible to non-technical users.
* [Notifications](https://docs.tally.xyz/knowledge-base/navigating-the-tally-platform/notifications)**:** Keeping Uniswap DAO members informed with real-time email notifications on proposal voting windows.
* **Gnosis Safe Integration:** Allowing for efficient, secure management of DAO assets.
* **Wallet Support:** Native support for a wide range of wallets so DAO participation is accessible to all Uniswap DAO members.
* [**Public API:**](https://www.notion.so/Proposals-1599632e110f41699eb5479778a6de2c?pvs=21) Enabling deeper integration with Uniswap’s ecosystem through Tally’s comprehensive public API.

**(3) Tally has an exciting roadmap for Uniswap DAO coming up.**

*Tally needs you*, the DAO participant, to help shape the future of Uniswap DAO’s governance tooling. We would like to offer a monthly office hours as an open feedback session for Uniswap DAO contributors to suggest new features and contribute to our roadmap. We receive a lot of inbound from Uniswap DAO contributors in informal settings and we would like to open this process up to the DAO in a more formal way.

## [](#p-54690-governance-improvements-on-roadmap-4)Governance Improvements on Roadmap

Looking ahead, Tally has many new features on its roadmap that may further elevate the Uniswap DAO’s governance experience. Some features and products on our roadmap that may be interesting to the Uniswap DAO community include:

* [Staking](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/uniswap/stake): Tally has built tooling and interfaces to support Uniswap UniStaker. We plan to also build out infrastructure for supporting native staking on Unichain UVN nodes.
* [Gasless Voting:](https://docs.tally.xyz/premium-features/relay) Similar to gasless delegation already in operation, Tally will stand up a relayer—to be funded by the Uniswap DAO— to relay voting transactions through Tally, making voting free for DAO members.
* [Forum Bot:](https://docs.tally.xyz/premium-features/forum-bot) Tally’s forum bot can post on the Uniswap DAO Discourse forum when voting starts and ends on the corresponding proposal.
* [Optimistic Governance](https://docs.tally.xyz/premium-features/optimistic-governance): Tally is building a council-based Governor, which will allow a council to share control over a protocol and/or treasury. It’s based on the similar Governor contract, but proposals are passed by a council’s votes instead of by token voting.
* **UI Support for Uniswap Accountability Committee:** Tally will provide a UI to display Uniswap Accountability Committee membership and transactions on [DAO Home page](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/uniswap).

Tally will provide a quarterly report for the Uniswap DAO, detailing key achievements, including uptime metrics, notes from Community Calls, support metrics, as well as enhancements to the Uniswap DAO’s governance on Tally (as outlined above).

## [](#p-54690-budget-and-timeline-5)Budget and Timeline

**Budget:**

* $250,000 annually for 2 years
* The Uniswap DAO will transfer $500,000 USD of UNI to the Uniswap Accountability Committee (UAC). The UAC will pay Tally quarterly at the start of each quarter $62,500 USD in UNI for the next 8 quarters.
* Our original proposal on Snapshot requested a 50% buffer in funds to account for price volatility, we have not included that in the onchain proposal and instead we will ask that Uniswap Accountability Committee have the right to request additional funds from the DAO in the event that price volatility means funds run out earlier than expected.&#x20;

**Proposal Timeline:**

* Post RFC for community feedback
* Incorporate feedback, hold Snapshot vote
* Onchain proposal to approve and allocate funding to \[RFC] Supporting Tally’s Continued Development and Enhancements for Uniswap DAO Governance

**KPIs**

Tally will provide a quarterly report for the Uniswap DAO, detailing key achievements, including uptime metrics, notes from Community Calls, support metrics, as well as enhancements to the Uniswap DAO’s governance on Tally (as outlined above).

* **Tally usage**
  * We will continue to track the number of proposals and % of votes per proposal made on Tally and report on those to the DAO.
* **Roadmap feature usage**
  * As we roll out new features for the Uniswap DAO, we will track usage of those features and report on them to the DAO.
* **Monthly office hours**
  * An open feedback session for Uniswap DAO contributors to suggest new features and contribute to our roadmap
* **Uptime and Availability**
  * System Uptime: 99% monthly uptime, ensuring the system is accessible with minimal disruptions.
  * Scheduled Downtime: Maximum of 2% monthly allowance for scheduled maintenance, communicated in advance.

**TLDR:**

On behalf of the Stabila Foundation, this proposal requests **$250k in UNI incentives** for **six months** to support seven key stablecoin-related pools on Celo, alongside **$105k for Oku** deployment and maintenance.

The [Stabila Foundation](https://medium.com/@StabilaFoundation/stabila-foundation-driving-stablecoin-adoption-on-celo-a3c1d2479e59), a community-driven initiative focused on stablecoin adoption, will contribute **$500k in CELO incentives** to amplify the impact of this initiative. Through Merkl, Stabila has already deployed **over $730k** in CELO incentives, contributing to the **5680% growth** in Uniswap volumes on Celo—from **$86.5M in 2023** to [$5B+ in 2024](https://dune.com/queries/3986372/6708452) (YTD) — establishing Celo as the [7th largest chain](https://dune.com/KARTOD/Uniswap-Mega-Dashboard-V2) by trading volume.

Celo is home to 13 native stablecoins—including USDT, USDC, and regional stables like BRLA and cKES—and is uniquely positioned to become a global hub for stablecoins. This proposal will deepen liquidity and attract diverse LPs to expand Uniswap’s reach into emerging markets. In turn, unlocking new opportunities for growth to establish a meaningful, long-term partnership with Uniswap DAO.

**About Celo**

Celo is a **mobile-first, EVM-compatible** blockchain focused on global financial inclusion, particularly in **emerging markets**. Empowering users across 150+ countries, Celo facilitates **fast, affordable transactions** through DeFi solutions tailored to underserved regions. Its diverse stablecoin ecosystem featuring **13 native stablecoins**, including USDT, USDC, cEUR, BRLA, COPM, and cKES, bridges digital assets with real-world use cases such as **remittances and cross-border payments**.

Celo is transitioning to an **Ethereum L2** on the **OP Stack**, with migration scheduled via hard fork in [Q1 2025](https://x.com/cLabs/status/1866181028957864252). This shift enhances scalability, security, and interoperability with Ethereum while retaining Celo’s mobile-first infrastructure. Importantly, **dApps like Uniswap will experience no disruption** during the migration, ensuring business as usual for liquidity providers and traders.

Upon joining the **OP Superchain**, Celo anticipates renewed ecosystem momentum by leveraging unique features such as [gas payments](https://docs.celo.org/cel2/fee-currencies#:~:text=You%20can%20use%20Fee%20Abstraction,native%20currency%20of%20the%20network.) **in stablecoins** (USDT, USDC, cUSD) and [Social Connect](https://socialconnect.xyz/), which enables **asset transfers via phone numbers**—further boosting accessibility and adoption.

Celo’s **mobile-first approach** uniquely positions itself to reach users in emerging markets, where mobile access is often the primary means of connecting to financial services. Key partnerships driving this adoption include:

* [Opera MiniPay](https://www.opera.com/products/minipay), a Celo stablecoin wallet with **3.5M+ users**, integrated into the Opera Mini mobile browser, which has over **100M monthly active users in Africa**.
* [Valora](https://valora.xyz/), a Celo-native wallet with **1M+ installs**, is driving significant adoption in mobile-first regions.

Along with other partnerships, these have solidified Celo’s position as a leader in the global stablecoin ecosystem. With over **600k+ daily active users** (DAUs), Celo ranks among the top 10 blockchains by user engagement (Source: [Token Terminal](https://tokenterminal.com/explorer/metrics/user-dau?v=NDRmMjkzOTZiNGE4Y2JjOGVkOWFkZDhi)).

**Background on Uniswap v3 on Celo:**
Uniswap v3 has been Celo’s **long-standing partner** since its deployment in July 2022, unlocking new liquidity and trading opportunities in **emerging markets**. The [Stabila Foundation](https://medium.com/@StabilaFoundation/stabila-foundation-driving-stablecoin-adoption-on-celo-a3c1d2479e59) has played a pivotal role in this success, distributing over $730k in CELO rewards through Merkl to incentivize **24 stablecoin-related pools**, with ongoing campaigns: [Merkl Campaign on Celo](https://merkl.angle.money/?chain=42220).

These efforts have driven a **5680%** increase in Uniswap volumes on Celo—from **$86.5M in 2023** to [$5B+ in 2024](https://dune.com/queries/3986372/6708452) (YTD )— elevating Celo to become the [7th largest blockchain by volume](https://dune.com/KARTOD/Uniswap-Mega-Dashboard-V2). This traction has attracted new stablecoin issuers to launch on Celo and fostered the creation of additional stablecoin-stablecoin Uniswap pools, which are essential for expanding liquidity and improving financial access.

This proposal builds on these successes and underscores Stabila’s commitment to fostering a deeper, long-term partnership with Uniswap DAO. Together, we can scale stablecoin liquidity and attract new issuers and LPs. By combining the strengths of both ecosystems, this partnership will help expand financial access in underserved regions and drive global growth and adoption.

**Proposed Plan:**

To further scale liquidity and strengthen Uniswap v3’s deployment on Celo, we propose the following:

**1. Direct UNI Incentives (6-Month Program):**

The requested **$250k** in UNI incentives will target seven key Uniswap v3 pools:

1. USDT/USDC (0.01%) - 30% of incentives
2. USDT/cUSD (0.01%) - 20% of incentives
3. USDT/cEUR (0.01%) - 15% of incentives
4. USDT/CELO (0.01%) - 15% of incentives
5. USDT/cKES (0.01%) - 10% of incentives
6. USDT/COPM (0.01%) - 5% of incentives
7. USDT/BRLA (0.01%) - 5% of incentives

These pools are strategically selected to deepen liquidity, support regional stablecoins, and strengthen Celo’s ecosystem by enabling microloans, cross-border payments, and remittances in underserved regions.

* cUSD is the most widely used stablecoin on [Opera MiniPay](https://www.opera.com/products/minipay)
* cEUR is popular among [Valora](https://valora.xyz/) users
* cKES supports [Haraka Finance](https://haraka.xyz/creditpools) in facilitating microloans in Kenya
* [COPM](https://minteo.com/) and [BRLA](https://brla.digital/) are leading fiat-backed stablecoins in their respective markets.

**2. Oku Deployment:**

Although Celo is currently available on the Uniswap interface, our community would find value in Oku’s Uniswap v3 analytics, advanced trading interface for Forex traders, liquidity provisioning and position management, on/off-ramping, and bridging to offer Celo users a complete experience.

***

**Amplified Impact:**

To amplify impact, **Stabila will contribute $500k in CELO Merkl incentives**, effectively matching Uniswap DAO’s $250k UNI incentive contribution at a **1.4:1 ratio** when factoring in Uniswap DAO’s total **$355k commitment**, which includes $105k for Oku deployment and maintenance. This ensures robust participation, liquidity growth, and sustained ecosystem support.

***

**Timing:**

Upon approval, Stabila Foundation will coordinate with the Oku team and the Accountability Committee to integrate Oku into Celo, enabling enhanced cross-chain liquidity and market access. The CELO and UNI incentives will commence after Celo’s L2 migration in Q1 2025, ensuring both initiatives align to drive liquidity growth effectively.

**Budget:**

* **$250k** in UNI incentives for six months (matched by Stabila with $500k in CELO)
* **$45k** for Oku integration (one-time payment)
* **$5k/month** for 12 months to maintain Oku services

**Overall Timeline:**

Below is the proposed timeline for delegates’ consideration. The timeline is an estimate and may be extended as needed:

* Request for Comment (RFC) ends **December 16**
* Temperature check **December 17-21**
* The onchain vote review period: **TBD**
* Onchain voting opens: **TBD**
* Oku to go live (one week after the onchain vote ends)
* Incentives to go live: After Celo’s L2 migration (Q1 2025) and Oku integration are completed.

We look forward to collaborating with Uniswap DAO to expand stablecoin liquidity and establish Celo as a global hub for stablecoins.

Uniswap DAO Principles
This onchain vote confirms a set of principles (the Principles) for the Uniswap DAO. The draft Principles were written by Atis (independent delegate) and Erik (Avantgarde Finance). We gratefully acknowledge the comments and suggestions from many other Uniswap DAO delegates and community members.

On executing the proposal, the Principles will be published onchain using the `setText` function of ENS Public Resolver contract for the `uniswap.eth` node.

## Uniswap DAO Principles

The delegates agree to recognize the following principles and let them guide their decision-making in Uniswap DAO governance.

### **Processual Principles**

* **Scope.** The purpose of the Uniswap DAO is to govern the Uniswap protocol \[1]. This includes protocol parameters adjustments and fund allocation to foster the growth of the Uniswap protocol \[2].
* **Process.** The Uniswap DAO follows the governance process \[3] as outlined in the Uniswap Docs and on the Uniswap Governance Forum.
* **Onchain Focus.** The operations of the DAO should focus on on-chain assets, and key decisions should be recorded onchain to preserve transparency at both operational and governance levels \[4]. This includes maintaining on-chain voting as part of the governance process, as is currently done, and using on-chain transactions to transfer funds.

### **Conduct-Related Principles**

* **Disclosure.** Conflicts of interest should be disclosed clearly on the delegate description page and, whenever relevant, in forum discussions and in the voting rationale. Severe conflicts of interest that could undermine the integrity of governance must be avoided. If a proposal includes specific actions, such as requiring delegates with conflicts of interest to abstain, these directives must be followed. In cases of doubt, delegates should err on the side of transparency and openness \[5].
* **Security.** Given the systemic importance of the Uniswap protocol to DeFi and the size of the DAO treasury, delegates must carefully consider security when making decisions. They should follow established processes to securely and effectively deliver products to the ecosystem, and vote against proposals that expose the protocol or treasury to risks. In ambiguous cases, the proposer must demonstrate the proposal is safe. However, delegates are not accountable for failing to anticipate all indirect consequences of a proposal.
* **Legibility.** To maintain the integrity of the governance process, rationales for votes should be published in a manner that is understandable to the broader community. Proposals and their reasoning should be clear to outsiders, even those unfamiliar with the history of DAO votes or without access to side-channel communication between delegates. Concrete data and empirical evidence should be included to back decision-making when available.
* **Good Faith.** Delegates should act with honesty and integrity when participating in governance, and vote in accordance with what they believe is in the best interest of the Uniswap protocol.
* **Due Care.** Delegates should conduct a professional review of each proposal prior to voting, and are advised to abstain from voting when unable to conduct the necessary diligence to understand a given proposal
* **Public Feedback.** Delegates should inform the community if they consider that a proposal is superficial, light, unclear or unsubstantiated and needs to be improved or deepened before it is submitted to a vote.

### **Structural Principles**

* **Decentralization.** Decision-making in the DAO should remain decentralized in all forms, with the aim of keeping the DAO credibly neutral, censorship-resistant and resilient against capture by any single group of aligned actors, whether internal or external \[6]. Delegates must prevent the formation of cartels and ensure that the protocol is protected from any proposals driven by personal motives that do not align with the protocol’s best interests.
* **Representation.** Delegates primarily represent UNI token holders, however, delegates should make a reasonable effort to understand the arguments from all potentially affected stakeholders when making decisions and be respectful of differing viewpoints.
* **Accountability.** Delegates are accountable to the Uniswap community and should show a willingness to communicate with affected stakeholders, remain open to scrutiny, and, where possible, communicate key rationales to maintain trust through transparent decision-making processes.
  The terms “should” and “must” in the text are expected to be interpreted following the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) guidelines \[7].

## Introduction

This proposal outlines Uniswap Governance’s adoption of the SEAL ([Security Alliance](https://www.securityalliance.org/)) Whitehat Safe Harbor Agreement (“Safe Harbor Agreement”). By adopting Safe Harbor, Uniswap improves the security of its on-chain assets by allowing whitehats to intervene during active exploits to save protocol funds.

### What is the Safe Harbor Agreement?

The Safe Harbor Agreement addresses a critical need in crypto: enabling whitehats to intervene during active exploits when traditional responsible disclosure procedures are not feasible.

Key aspects of the agreement include:

* Encouraging Whitehats to Protect the Protocol: By adopting Safe Harbor, Uniswap incentivizes whitehats to step in and protect the protocol during active exploits by limiting their legal exposure.
* Intervention Only During Active Exploits: Whitehats are authorized to act only when there is an immediate or ongoing exploit that threatens the protocol. This agreement applies only to critical situations where responsible disclosure procedures would not save funds due to the urgency of the exploit, and it is not intended for routine security testing or vulnerability reporting.
* Mandatory Return of Rescued Funds: Under the terms of the Safe Harbor, whitehats are required to return all rescued assets to a pre-designated recovery address controlled by the protocol within 72 hours of recovering them. This ensures that recovered funds are quickly secured, preventing delay or potential loss.
* Clear Guidelines and Legal Protection: The agreement establishes strict rules for how whitehats must operate during an exploit, ensuring recovery efforts are conducted professionally and safely, minimizing the risk of mistakes or further damage to the protocol. By adhering to these guidelines, whitehats can limit their potential legal exposure, allowing them to act in good faith without fear of liability.
* Incentivized Rescue Efforts: To motivate whitehats to act during critical situations, the agreement offers a bounty system similar to a bug bounty. Whitehats are rewarded with a percentage of the recovered assets, up to a predefined cap, for their successful interventions.

## Rationale

Uniswap, by design, does not include a pause function, meaning the protocol cannot be halted in the event of an exploit. This makes it essential to have a mechanism that allows rapid response and asset recovery during emergencies.

The Safe Harbor Agreement provides this necessary solution, empowering whitehats to act immediately during an exploit, offering a swift and structured recovery process without needing to pause the protocol.

Benefits of adopting the Safe Harbor Agreement include:

* Agile Defense Against Exploits: Whitehats are authorized to intervene as soon as an active exploit is detected, enabling them to respond faster than traditional methods. This ensures that Uniswap is protected against threats even without the ability to halt the protocol. Immediate action minimizes the window for malicious actors, reduces damages, and accelerates the recovery of assets during critical moments.
* Clarified Rescue Process: The agreement ensures that every step, from intervention to fund recovery, is predetermined and streamlined. Whitehats know exactly where to send recovered funds, preventing chaotic negotiations or rushed decisions during an exploit. This clarity ensures efficient, decisive action when it matters most.
* Clear Financial Boundaries: The predefined bounty system, with a cap matching Uniswap Labs’ existing bug bounty for V3, ensures that whitehats are incentivized fairly without creating conflicting priorities between exploit intervention and standard vulnerability disclosure. By setting expectations upfront, it eliminates post-exploit negotiations, ensuring funds are returned promptly without attempts to change the reward amount, keeping the process fair and transparent.
* Aligning with Industry Best Practices: By adopting the Safe Harbor Agreement, Uniswap aligns itself with leading security practices across the industry, reinforcing its commitment to staying at the forefront of protocol security.

Adoption of the agreement complements audits by providing an additional layer of security, ensuring that the protocol is better prepared to respond to active threats.

* “All”: The Safe Harbor Agreement will cover both the subcontracts currently deployed under this contract and any future subcontracts deployed through it. This ensures that all present and future subcontracts are protected.

1. Contact Details: Designated security contact for Uniswap
   * Name: Erin Koen
   * Contact Information: [erin@uniswapfoundation.org](mailto:erin@uniswapfoundation.org)
     * Every 4 months. The person of contact will create a post to state their availability and whether or not they can continue being the person of contact.
2. Bounty Terms: Predetermined rewards for successful whitehats that protect protocol funds
   * Bounty Percentage: 10% of recovered funds.
   * Bounty Cap (USD): [$2.25m](https://blog.uniswap.org/uniswap-labs-bug-bounty-update)
     * For clarification, the bounty is per whitehat per hack event. Please see the legal document for additional clarification.
   * Retainable: True
     * This means that whitehats are allowed to retain their bounty directly from the recovered assets. After rescuing funds during an exploit, whitehats may deduct their bounty from the total recovered amount before transferring the remainder to the protocol’s designated asset recovery address. This streamlines the payout process, ensuring whitehats are rewarded promptly while still adhering to predefined bounty terms.
   * Identity Verification: Anonymous
     * Whitehats are allowed to remain anonymous and are not required to provide their legal name or undergo identity verification. This ensures privacy for whitehats while still enabling them to participate in the bounty program and assist during exploits without revealing personal information.
   * Diligence Requirements: None

## Implementation Plan

1. Register Agreement On-Chain:
   * The agreement will be registered on Ethereum in the Safe Harbor Registry at address 0x8f72fcf695523a6fc7dd97eafdd7a083c386b7b6, including all adoptionDetails. This ensures transparency and immutability.
2. Communicate Adoption:
   * An official announcement will be made across all Uniswap communication channels, explaining the adoption and its significance to the community.
3. Future Updates to Scope:
   * New versions of Uniswap (e.g., V4) will be reviewed and added to the Safe Harbor Agreement scope via Uniswap Governance vote, ensuring continued protection for all new contracts and functionalities.

***

## Conclusion

Adopting the SEAL Whitehat Safe Harbor Agreement equips Uniswap with a rapid response mechanism for active exploits, enabling whitehats to step in effectively when needed most. The agreement provides clear guidelines for action, increasing the protection of user funds and demonstrating Uniswap's commitment to proactive security.

#### Uniswap Delegate Reward Initiative - Cycle 3

Authors: @Doo\_StableLab @PGov @AranaDigital @seedgov

## Summary

This proposal outlines the Uniswap Delegate Reward Initiative—Cycle 3, a compensation program designed to improve and sustain the participation quality and dedication among Uniswap delegates following the conclusion of Cycle 1 and 2.

## Background

In late February 2024, StableLab proposed the [Uniswap Delegate Reward Initiative](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-uniswap-delegate-reward/22909). After the GovSwap event in Denver, further research to plan and implement the Delegate Reward Initiative was highlighted, leading to the formation of the Uniswap Delegate Reward Working Group, composed of 8 members from different organizations. After extensive research for more than a month, the Working Group produced several findings, which can be found here: [https://gov.uniswap.org/t/findings-from-uniswap-delegate-reward-working-group/23702](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/findings-from-uniswap-delegate-reward-working-group/23702)

Incorporating these findings, the Uniswap Delegate Reward Initiative Cycle 1 was [proposed](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temp-check-uniswap-delegate-reward-3-months-cycle-1/23837) and [launched](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/uniswap/proposal/64) in June 2024. Cycle 1 was successful in that the 12 delegates selected maintained 100% voting participation rate for votes during this period. In addition, several new delegates joined the protocol due to the presence of incentives.

With learnings from Cycle 1, including how to make a points system to determine the top delegate applicants in a more fair and objective manner, along with a tier system to incorporate different participation levels of delegates, Cycle 2 was [launched.](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/uniswap/proposal/68)

## Cycle 3 Proposal Details

Application Eligibility

* There will be a week-long period for candidates to submit their applications. The top 15 delegates will be determined based on a point system outlined below.
* Delegates from Cycle 2 must apply again for Cycle 3–they will not be automatically included.
* Only delegates who have participated in onchain voting for at least three months prior to the application post are eligible for Cycle 3.

## Uniswap Delegate Reward Cycle 3 Metrics

In case there are more than 15 eligible applicants, the top 15 will be chosen by the following objective metrics. The highest number of available points will be 11.

**1. Voting Participation**

Since a delegate's primary role is to utilize voting power from delegators and vote in Uniswap’s best interest, active participation is essential to ensuring quorums are met and malicious proposals are thwarted. This category carries a total of 7 points, with onchain voting weighted more heavily due to its ability to directly impact governance contracts and direct treasury funds. The voting rate is evaluated based on the past six months.

Offchain Voting (Snapshot)

90% and above: 3
80% to 90% : 2
70% till 80% : 1.5
60% till 70%: 1
50% till 60%: 0.5
50% or below: 0

Onchain Voting

90% and above : 4
80% till 90% : 2.5
70% till 80%: 1.5
60% till 70%: 1
50% till 60%: 0.5
Below 50%: 0

**2. Proposal Authorship**

Contributing to proposal drafting for Uniswap DAO is valuable, but maintaining quality and preventing malicious proposals is equally important. As a result, only successfully passed votes are counted. This category is worth a total of 3 points, with onchain proposals receiving greater weight once again.

For non-binary proposals, if a ""No"" equivalent option was available and the final voting outcome was a choice other than ""No,"" the proposal qualifies for points in this category. For example, the Uniswap Treasury Working Group (UTWG) Election would not be eligible, as there was no ""No"" vote option. However, the \[Temp] Uni Onboarding Package - BSC would qualify, since an ""Against"" option was present, and the final outcome was ""$1M.""

Authored or Co-authored a proposal that passed offchain (Snapshot) vote before.

Yes, 2 or more: 1
Yes, 1: 0.5
No: 0

Authored or Co authored a proposal that passed onchain vote before

Yes, 2 or more: 2
Yes, 1: 1
No: 0

**3. Community Participation**

The full point for this category is 1.

Community Calls (attendance for September, October, December 2024 & January - Feb 2025)

Attended at least 80% of calls: 1
Attended at least 50% of calls: 0.5

**Tie Breaker**

1. Ties will be decided by the date of the first onchain vote that these applicants cast in order to reward delegates who have been contributing to Uniswap governance for an extended period. The tie-breaking value will be determined based on the end date of the vote in which the delegates participated, not the onchain date when the vote was cast.
2. In the event of a tie with the first tie-breaker criterion, priority will be given to the delegate who has cast the most votes in the last 6 months.
3. In the event that the tie persists further, the final decision will favor the delegate who was first to present their delegation platform—hence, priority will be given to the individual/entity who first publicly declared their intention to become a delegate.

**Delegate Reward Eligibility**

Once delegates have passed the application process, they must fulfill the following requirements to be eligible for up to $6,000 USD worth of $UNI reward per month.

**Requirements**

1. Maintain a minimum of 80% participation in onchain and off-chain voting during the last 3 months to be eligible to receive up to $3,000 worth of $UNI per month, with the proportional payment based on each delegate's participation in the total votes cast during the last 3 months (number of votes cast x 100 / total votes cast during the last 3 months). For example, if there were 10 votes cast in the last 3 months and a delegate voted on 8 of them, that delegate will receive 80% of the $3,000 USD, i.e. the delegate will be eligible to receive $2,400. If another delegate voted on 7 of those votes, that delegate will not be eligible to receive any rewards as their participation was 70% of the votes, below the 80% minimum.

Additional Rewards (the below are only available if the above Requirement of Voting Participation is fulfilled)

2a. Write rationale for the voting on their delegate profile.

* Deadline for writing rationale would be 7 days from the end of each vote.

2b. Attend Uniswap Community Calls.

Achieving these above will provide an additional up to $3,000 USD worth of $UNI. For 2a and 2b, there will also be proportional payment. For example, if there were 4 votings and 1 community call, and a delegate missed writing a rationale of 2 of the votes, the delegate would be eligible to receive $1800 \[3/5 \* $3000].

**Budget**

We are requesting 540,000 \[6000 USD \*6 Months \*15 Delegates ] USD worth of UNI for cycle 3 of the Uniswap Delegate Reward Initiative.

The total amount, once approved, will be sent to the Accountability Committee, which will be responsible for the monthly distribution of rewards to eligible delegates. Since the total budget of the Delegate Reward WG has not been fully used, administration of this reward program–including the creation of this proposal and the admin work behind verifying monthly delegate participation–will be allotted from that account, with no additional costs to the DAO. Therefore, the total budget request will be solely for the delegate pay.

The Uniswap community is entering 2025 with the momentum of three positive catalysts: a more collaborative regulatory environment, the launch of Uniswap v4, and the debut of Unichain. As we look to the months and years ahead, we see the potential for Uniswap Protocol and Unichain to cement themselves as foundational infrastructure for digital value transfer.

The Uniswap community has always pioneered—but pioneers don’t stay ahead by standing still. Achieving this vision will require more than just technological innovation; it demands strengthening network effects and evolving our governance system to fund, sustain, and grow the Protocol independently over time. We call for action, and for the broader community to work alongside us as we evolve Uniswap to its next era.

In [this proposal](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/governance-proposal-uniswap-unleashed/25251), we define four strategic priorities for the years ahead:

**Scaling network supply**: Provide most capital efficiency across active EVM chains

**Scaling network demand**: Create premier DeFi development platforms

**Equipping Governance and the community**: Activate revenue

**Equipping Governance and the community**: Onboard Protocol Core Contributors

In this proposal, we discuss not only these priorities but also how we expect to achieve them alongside the community and how we, the UF, will measure our success. We also discuss our budget request to achieve these goals. Today we are also posting [a request for incentives](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-uniswap-unleashed-unichain-and-uniswap-v4-liquidity-incentives/25250) to support the growth of Uniswap v4 and Unichain. If approved, these funds would be managed, within pre-set parameters and onchain, by Gauntlet, while having control maintained by Uniswap Governance.

In this proposal, we are requesting an investment of $95.4M into the UF grants budget, and $25.1M to fund operations, for the next 2 years to fund these priorities. Based on today's (March 11, 2025) [daily opening price](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/uniswap/historical_data) of $5.93, this equates to 20,320,405 UNI.

We recognize and appreciate the size of this request. It reflects an investment into the success of the Uniswap Protocol and Unichain, and into value for the Uniswap community. Founded in 2022 with a singular focus on Uniswap v3, the UF now leads the growth of the developer ecosystem for a true developer platform in Uniswap v4, and an L2, Unichain. In addition, we are leveling up Governance to support long term sustainability with the creation of a Core Contributor program, new tooling like Conditional Funding markets, and more.

This proposal is an investment into the future of the Uniswap community. It is designed to match the scale of our mission while being backstopped by best-in-industry transparency reporting and an unrelenting drive to create value.

## Summary

Proposal to Fund Unichain and v4 Liquidity Incentive Programs proposed by the Uniswap Foundation, with contributions from Gauntlet

Forum post [here](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-uniswap-unleashed-unichain-and-uniswap-v4-liquidity-incentives/25250?u=0xkeyrock.eth). Temp check [here](https://v1.snapshot.box/#/uniswapgovernance.eth/proposal/0xe7fb39bd6f16b65d0847cdd6ab6ecef3a6c1e89bd523cf895f3d806c4bb4b1cf).

## Specification

Gauntlet has deployed and configured an Aera vault for the Uniswap Foundation on mainnet. Ownership transfer has been initiated from Gauntlet to the Uniswap [Timelock contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1a9c8182c09f50c8318d769245bea52c32be35bc). If passed, this proposal will accept the ownership transfer to the UNI Timelock and resume the vault. After successfully transferring ownership and resuming the Aera vault, the proposal will approve and deposit UNI tokens into the Aera vault. This step ensures that the vault is properly funded to support liquidity incentives.

1. Accept ownership of the Aera [vault](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7c8406384f7a5c147a6ADd16407803BE146147E4), [asset registry](https://etherscan.io/address/0x77A3460801FA71aC747e34C1C5582ee472B906b9), and [hooks](https://etherscan.io/address/0xEC645C3750021Db8b155EF12094bb0395e8c107c). These calls accept the transfer of ownership of the Aera vault, asset registry, and hooks to the UNI timelock.
2. Resume the Aera vault.
3. Approve the Aera vault as spender of 7,588,532 UNI from Timelock.
4. Deposit 7,588,532 UNI into the Aera vault.

The Uniswap community is entering 2025 with the momentum of three positive catalysts: a more collaborative regulatory environment, the launch of Uniswap v4, and the debut of Unichain. As we look to the months and years ahead, we see the potential for Uniswap Protocol and Unichain to cement themselves as foundational infrastructure for digital value transfer.

The Uniswap community has always pioneered—but pioneers don’t stay ahead by standing still. Achieving this vision will require more than just technological innovation; it demands strengthening network effects and evolving our governance system to fund, sustain, and grow the Protocol independently over time. We call for action, and for the broader community to work alongside us as we evolve Uniswap to its next era.

In [this proposal](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/governance-proposal-uniswap-unleashed/25251), we define four strategic priorities for the years ahead:

**Scaling network supply**: Provide most capital efficiency across active EVM chains

**Scaling network demand**: Create premier DeFi development platforms

**Equipping Governance and the community**: Activate revenue

**Equipping Governance and the community**: Onboard Protocol Core Contributors

In this proposal, we discuss not only these priorities but also how we expect to achieve them alongside the community and how we, the UF, will measure our success. We also discuss our budget request to achieve these goals. Today we are also posting [a request for incentives](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-uniswap-unleashed-unichain-and-uniswap-v4-liquidity-incentives/25250) to support the growth of Uniswap v4 and Unichain. If approved, these funds would be managed, within pre-set parameters and onchain, by Gauntlet, while having control maintained by Uniswap Governance.

In this proposal, we are requesting an investment of $95.4M into the UF grants budget, and $25.1M to fund operations, for the next 2 years to fund these priorities. Based on today's (March 11, 2025) [daily opening price](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/uniswap/historical_data) of $5.93, this equates to 20,320,405 UNI.

We recognize and appreciate the size of this request. It reflects an investment into the success of the Uniswap Protocol and Unichain, and into value for the Uniswap community. Founded in 2022 with a singular focus on Uniswap v3, the UF now leads the growth of the developer ecosystem for a true developer platform in Uniswap v4, and an L2, Unichain. In addition, we are leveling up Governance to support long term sustainability with the creation of a Core Contributor program, new tooling like Conditional Funding markets, and more.

This proposal is an investment into the future of the Uniswap community. It is designed to match the scale of our mission while being backstopped by best-in-industry transparency reporting and an unrelenting drive to create value.

**Transaction Details**

This transaction calls the transfer function on the UNI token contract and passes it the amount (in the appropriate format) and the recipient address.
