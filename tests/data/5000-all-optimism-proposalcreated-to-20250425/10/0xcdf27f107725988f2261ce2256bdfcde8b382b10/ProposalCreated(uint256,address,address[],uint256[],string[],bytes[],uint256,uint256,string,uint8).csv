The Chain Delegation Program was introduced in Season 5, to help new OP Chains onboard and build their delegation in Optimism’s governance. While this program is approved through the first 15 Chains completing their temporary 12 months of delegation via the program, the Foundation would like to propose a small amendment to the Chain Delegation Program starting in Season 7.

This amendment seeks to align this program more closely with the Season 7 Intent: A set of Stage 1 chains doing $250M per month in cross-chain asset transfers.

The proposal suggests moving “satisfying the Standard Rollup Charter criteria,” to be the first criteria rather than the last. This would effectively mean the program is only applicable to OP Chains satisfying the Standard Rollup Charter criteria.

All other qualification criteria will remain unchanged (as previously approved).

This Protocol Upgrade makes several improvements to the Standard Rollup Charter’s Onchain Criteria. Primarily, it adds additional requirements for standardization which were previously enforced by the Optimism Foundation via Offchain Criteria.

This is a non-fork upgrade, meaning no upgrades to smart contracts or off-chain node software are required. This upgrade is accompanied by the “Superchain Registry 2.0,” a refactor of the Superchain Registry which reflects these improvements and makes other quality-of-life updates for its maintainers.

This small Protocol Upgrade strengthens the Onchain Criteria for Standard Chains as we prepare for more chains in the Superchain to move to Stage 1.

* outlines the implementation of a new system for upgrading L1 contracts across the Superchain (OP Contracts Manager),
* introduces technical improvements to several key contracts to enable more flexible and less disruptive ways to respond to any potential incidents in the OP Stack fault proof system (Fault Proofs Incident Response Improvements), and
* introduces a new [Safe Module](https://docs.safe.global/advanced/smart-account-modules) called the `DeputyPauseModule` to be installed into the Optimism Foundation Safe to simplify the process of quickly responding to security incidents via the Superchain-wide pause mechanism (Superchain Pause Improvements).
