This proposal outlines the Optimism Collective’s first network upgrade after Bedrock, titled Canyon. The Canyon upgrade contains the Shapella network upgrade from Ethereum, a change to reduce the volatility of the basefee, and several minor bug fixes. This upgrade maintains EVM equivalence and includes several OP Stack specific improvements.

Canyon is code complete in the optimism monorepo at commit 6cce3728b7bed5e36234aeba3b773e0f97867be3 and op-geth at commit ed8e9f54ed0a5069e77ea34895ff12a9ac4ca17f
If this vote passes, Canyon will activate on op-mainnet, base-mainnet, pgn-mainnet, & zora-mainnet on Thu Jan 11 17:00:01 UTC 2024 (Unix Time 1704992401) barring a critical security issue.

This vote requires a 76% approval threshold. The value displayed by the frontend may differ.
